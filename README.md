# TTRPGs

A collection of tabletop roleplaying games by Wesley Giles.

## Games

### Bound
*A Game of Oaths & Loopholes*

Every player character draws power from Contracts — binding agreements forged with powerful entities. Gods, spirits, fey lords, eldritch intelligences, or abstract forces of the universe itself. Power is never free. Every gift comes with a leash.

- [Core Rules](Bound/core.html)
- [The Grind](Bound/Settings/TheGrind.html) — A setting of ambient horror and late capitalism
