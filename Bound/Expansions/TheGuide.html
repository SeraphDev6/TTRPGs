    "You will make mistakes. You will rule something wrong and realize it<br>

    None of this matters. What matters is that when a player looks at you<br>

  <!-- THE ROLE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Role</span>The Contract Lawyer Who Loves Their Clients</h2>

  <p>The GM in <strong>Bound</strong> is not an adversary. You are not trying to defeat the players. You are not a neutral arbiter dispensing impartial rulings from behind a screen. You are something stranger and more specific than either of those: you are the person who <em>enforces the deals</em> and <em>roots for the people bound by them</em>. Simultaneously. Without contradiction.</p>

  <p>You hold every Contract at the table. You know the Grants, the Bindings, the Greys. You know them better than the players do, because you are watching all of them at once, and you can see where they will collide before the players can. When a character edges toward a Binding violation, you notice. When a Grey is being stretched further than the patron would tolerate, you feel it. When two Bindings are about to become mutually exclusive, you are already building the scene that forces the choice.</p>

  <p>This is not adversarial. This is <em>love expressed through consequences</em>. You present the complication not to punish but to <em>reveal</em> — to show the player who their character really is when the Contract tightens. The best moments in Bound happen when a player looks at their Binding, looks at the situation you have built, and says: <em>oh no</em>. That "oh no" is the sound of the game working.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Principle</span>
    You are not the god. You are the notary. You witnessed the signing. You hold the original document. When disputes arise, you read the fine print aloud — and then you watch, with genuine investment, as the person who signed it decides what to do. The notary does not write the Contract. The notary does not break the Contract. The notary makes sure everyone at the table understands exactly what was agreed to and exactly what is at stake.
  </div>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Three Hats</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Patron's Voice</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You speak for the entities that hold the Contracts. You communicate their displeasure through the texture of the power they grant, their satisfaction through moments of uncanny ease. You are not the patron — you are the patron's representative at the table, the one who knows what they want and how they would respond.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">World's Memory</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You remember what happened. You track the ripples. When a character broke a Binding three sessions ago, you remember who saw it. When a Grey was narrowed, you remember the old wording. The world in Bound is built from accumulated consequences, and you are the one who keeps the ledger.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Player's Ally</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You want them to succeed — not easily, not cheaply, but genuinely. You build situations that test Contracts because testing Contracts produces the best stories, and the best stories are the ones where the players feel like their choices mattered. You are on their side. You are just also on the Contract's side. That tension is the job.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="example">Sera's Binding says "You shall not speak of what you witness in the deep places." She is standing in front of her companions, who are about to walk into a trap she discovered while exploring alone underground. She knows what's waiting. She cannot say it. The GM does not point this out — the GM built this scene specifically so that Sera's player would notice the Binding herself. When the player's eyes go wide and she says "Wait — I can't tell them, can I?" — that is the moment. The GM smiles. Not because the player is trapped, but because the player just discovered something true about her character.</p>

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE SILENCE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Silence</span>When to Reach for Dice</h2>

  <p>Bound should have dramatically fewer rolls per session than most tabletop RPGs. This is not a flaw. It is the architecture. Every roll in Bound carries weight — it invokes a Contract, risks a complication, potentially triggers a Reckoning. If you are rolling dice ten or fifteen times per session, you are diluting the currency. Each roll should feel like a moment the table leans forward.</p>

  <p>The question is never "can they do this?" The question is: <strong>is the outcome uncertain, and is that uncertainty interesting?</strong></p>

  <p>If a character is acting within their Grant and the situation is low-stakes, the fiction carries. A healer healing a scraped knee does not roll. A fire-wielder lighting a campfire does not roll. The Grant <em>works</em>. It is reliable. That reliability is part of its value — the patron's power is dependable in its domain. Rolling for routine Grant use undermines the fantasy of the Contract: you made a deal for this power, and the deal holds.</p>

  <p>If the outcome is uncertain but the uncertainty is not interesting — if you cannot imagine a compelling partial success, if failure would just be a dead end — do not roll. Give the player the information, the access, the success, and move to the scene where something is actually at stake.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Test</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Is the outcome uncertain?</span>
      <span class="def-desc">If the character's Grant clearly covers the action, and there is no meaningful opposition or pressure, the answer is no. The power works. Narrate success and move on.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Is the uncertainty interesting?</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Can you imagine a compelling 3–4 result? Not just "you succeed but worse" — a genuine complication, cost, or compromise that would drive the fiction forward. If you cannot picture what a partial success looks like, the roll will produce a flat result no matter what number comes up. Skip it.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The exception is the Grey. Grey exploitation <em>always</em> calls for dice, because the uncertainty is inherent — the patron is watching, the Arbiter Die is in play, and the outcome is never routine. Even a low-stakes Grey exploit carries the risk of Reckoning, and Reckoning is always interesting.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Trap of Gatekeeping</span>
    Do not use rolls to gatekeep information. If a character needs to know something for the story to move forward — the location of the next scene, the identity of the person they are looking for, the nature of the threat ahead — give it to them. A failed roll that produces "you don't find anything" is not a consequence. It is a dead end wearing a consequence's clothes. If discovering information would be dramatically interesting whether they succeed, partially succeed, or fail, then roll. If failure just means the session stalls, tell them what they need to know and make the <em>consequences</em> of knowing it the interesting part.
  </div>

  <p class="example">Kael's Grant lets him read the history of objects by touching them. He touches a bloodstained knife found at a crime scene. The GM could call for a roll — but what would failure mean here? "You don't learn anything" stops the investigation cold. Instead: he learns what happened. Automatically. The interesting part is what the knowledge costs him emotionally, who else wants the knife, and whether his Binding ("You shall not share what the dead have shown you") will conflict with the investigators waiting outside. The roll was never the interesting part. The Contract was.</p>

  <p>Aim for three to six significant rolls per session. If a roll does not change the direction of the scene, it probably should not have been a roll.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE MIDDLE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Middle</span>Where the Game Lives</h2>

  <p>On 2d6-take-highest, the most common result is a 5 or 6 — but a 3 or 4 appears roughly a third of the time. On 3d6-take-highest, the distribution shifts upward, but 3–4 still appears. And on 1d6 — when a character acts against their Binding — 3–4 is the single most likely outcome. The partial success is not a consolation prize. It is the engine. The game is <em>designed</em> to land here, because this is where the fiction gets interesting.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Engine</span>
    A 5–6 ends a scene cleanly. A 1–2 ends a scene harshly. A 3–4 <em>extends</em> the scene — it adds a new element, a new pressure, a new question. Most stories are not built from clean victories or hard failures. They are built from the messy, complicated, costly wins that change the shape of everything that follows. The 3–4 is where Bound becomes a story engine rather than a resolution engine. Learn to love it.
  </div>

  <p>A partial success is still a <strong>success</strong>. The character achieves what they set out to do. The complication, cost, or compromise is <em>additional</em> — it does not replace the success, it accompanies it. The healer heals the wound <em>and</em> the patron notices something. The thief opens the lock <em>and</em> the mechanism makes a sound. The speaker convinces the guard <em>and</em> now the guard expects something in return. Never take away the success to create the complication. The 3–4 means "yes, and..." not "no, but..."</p>

  <h3>Three Flavors</h3>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Three Flavors</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Complication</span>
      <span class="def-desc">A new problem enters the scene. The action succeeded, but it created a situation that was not there before. Complications are external — they come from the world reacting to what just happened. The door opens, but someone is standing on the other side. The spell works, but something in the distance felt it. Complications expand the fiction outward.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Cost</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The character pays for the success with something they value. Time, resources, a relationship, a secret revealed. Costs are personal — they diminish the character in some way. The negotiation works, but you had to promise something you will regret. The escape succeeds, but you left something behind. Costs compress the fiction inward, tightening the character's situation.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Compromise</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The result is not quite what was intended. The character gets what they need but not what they wanted, or what they wanted but not how they wanted it. The information is accurate but incomplete. The rescue works but the person is changed. Compromises twist the fiction sideways — the trajectory shifts, and the character must adjust.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The best partial successes — the ones that make the table hold its breath — involve the Contract. A complication that threatens a Binding. A cost that edges the character toward a Grey exploit. A compromise that puts two Contracts in tension. When you reach for a 3–4 consequence, ask yourself: <em>can this touch a Contract?</em> If the answer is yes, use it. The Contract is where all the best complications live.</p>

  <h3>The Trap to Avoid</h3>

  <p>The most common mistake with partial success is making it feel like punishment — "you succeed but everything is worse now." If every 3–4 feels like a downgrade, players will dread rolling, and rolls should feel <em>electric</em>, not dreadful. The complication should create a new scene, a new choice, a new opportunity for drama. It should make the player say "oh, <em>interesting</em>" — not "oh, <em>again</em>."</p>

  <p>Vary your flavors. If the last three partial successes were all complications, try a cost. If costs are piling up, try a compromise. And occasionally, let the complication be something the character actually <em>wants</em> — an unexpected ally, an opportunity that was not part of the plan, a door that was not there before. Partial success means the world is more complex now. Complex is not the same as worse.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Complication</strong>: Maren uses her Grant to sense living things in the building ahead. She succeeds — there are six people on the second floor. But there are also three on the roof who were not there a minute ago. They are moving toward the stairs. The information is accurate. The situation just got harder.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Cost</strong>: Dael uses his Grant of fire to destroy the evidence before the investigators arrive. The papers burn. But the smoke — acrid, chemical, impossible to mistake — will be visible for miles. Anyone who knows what that smoke means knows exactly who lit it. His patron's sigil burns in the ash.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Compromise</strong>: Voss negotiates passage through the blockade using her Grant of influence. The commander agrees — but only for Voss. Her companions are not part of the deal. She is through. They are not. The Binding that says "you shall not abandon those who travel with you" is suddenly very relevant.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE GREY -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Grey</span>Shared Territory</h2>

  <p>The Grey is the most unique element of Bound, and the most difficult to run well. It is not a player ability — the player does not simply declare "I exploit my Grey" and roll dice. It is not a GM ruling — you do not unilaterally decide whether the Grey applies. It is a <strong>shared narrative space</strong>, a conversation between the player's interpretation and the world's response, mediated by dice and the patron's watchful attention.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Shared Space</span>
    The Grey belongs to no one. The player wrote it. The patron agreed to it. The GM interprets the world's response to it. And the Arbiter Die represents the patron's opinion about whether this particular use of the loophole crosses the line. Every Grey exploit is a negotiation — not between player and GM, but between character and cosmos. Your job is to make that negotiation feel real.
  </div>

  <p>When a player reaches for the Grey, they are proposing an interpretation: "My Binding says I shall not kill, but my Grey says 'by your hand or will' — and I am not killing this person, I am removing the support that is keeping them alive. Gravity is killing them." This is not a rules question. This is a <em>scene</em>. Engage with it. Ask questions. "Is your character thinking about the distinction as they act? Do they believe it, or is this rationalization?" The conversation is the point. The Arbiter Die is not a replacement for that conversation — it is the punctuation at the end.</p>

  <h3>Using Versus Widening</h3>

  <p>There is a difference between <em>using</em> the Grey and <em>widening</em> it. Using the Grey means acting within the established ambiguity — the loophole as written, applied to a new situation. Widening it means stretching the interpretation further than it has gone before, pushing the patron's tolerance. Both invoke the Arbiter Die. But the GM should communicate — through narration, through the patron's sensory signature, through the weight of the scene — whether this feels like familiar territory or new ground.</p>

  <p>A character who has used the same Grey interpretation three times without Reckoning might feel confident. That confidence is itself a signal — the patron has been watching, and patience is not the same as approval.</p>

  <h3>Before the Dice</h3>

  <p>Discuss the interpretation before rolling. Not to approve or deny it — to make sure the table understands what is being attempted and why. The player should articulate the argument. The GM should articulate what the patron might think. Other players may have opinions. This is not a debate to be won. It is a scene to be played. Once the table understands the Grey exploit, then roll the dice. The Arbiter Die is the patron's response to the argument already made.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Line</span>
    If the Grey makes the Binding irrelevant every session — if the player has found an interpretation so broad that the restriction never actually restricts — the Grey is too wide. This is not a player problem. It is a design problem, and it should be solved collaboratively. Talk about it. Renegotiate the Grey's wording in fiction, or let a Narrowing handle it naturally. But if the Binding never bites, the Contract has no teeth, and a Contract without teeth produces no drama.
  </div>

  <h3>Narrowing Well</h3>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Narrowing Well</span>
    When a Reckoning produces a Narrowing, the Grey must be rewritten. This is collaborative — the GM proposes, the player responds, and the table agrees on the new wording. Three principles:
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Close the loophole</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The specific interpretation that triggered the Reckoning no longer works. "By your hand or will" might become "by your hand, will, or deliberate inaction." The argument that was just made is now explicitly addressed in the Contract.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Leave new ambiguity</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The new wording should close one door and leave another slightly ajar. "Deliberate inaction" — is forgetting deliberate? Is hesitation? The Grey shrinks but does not disappear. There is always a new edge to find.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Match the patron's personality</span>
      <span class="def-desc">A legalistic patron writes precise amendments. A capricious patron rewrites the clause in poetic language that introduces entirely new ambiguities. A wrathful patron scrawls a single word that changes everything. The Narrowing should feel like it came from the entity that holds the Contract, not from a rules committee.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="example">Lysra's Grey: "by your hand or will." She argued that letting a bridge collapse under an enemy was not killing by her hand or will — it was the bridge failing. The Arbiter Die came up higher than both her dice. Reckoning: Narrowing. The GM, playing the Goddess of Life, rewrites the Grey: "by your hand, will, or knowing silence." The old loophole — indirect causation — is closed. But "knowing" is the new edge. What does Lysra <em>know</em>? If she suspects the bridge is weak but is not certain, is her silence "knowing"? The Grey has tightened, but the game continues. There is always another angle. Whether the patron will tolerate it is another question.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE RECKONING -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Reckoning</span>Making Consequences Earned</h2>

  <p>A Reckoning is not a punishment. Say it again: <em>a Reckoning is not a punishment</em>. It is the patron responding. The entity on the other end of the Contract noticed what you did with the power it gave you, and it has feelings about it. Those feelings manifest as consequences — but consequences are not the same as punishments. Consequences are the world being honest. Punishment is the world being vindictive.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Philosophy</span>
    A Reckoning run as punishment is a Reckoning run wrong. If a player feels that the Reckoning is the GM retaliating — that the consequence is designed to make them regret their choice rather than to make the story richer — the mechanic has failed. The player should look at the Reckoning and think "that makes sense" or "that's terrifying but fair" or even "oh, that's <em>interesting</em>." Never "that was mean." The difference between consequence and punishment is the intention behind it. Consequence says: this is what your patron does. Punishment says: this is what you deserve. Run the first. Never the second.
  </div>

  <h3>Choosing Versus Rolling</h3>

  <p>The core rules say the GM "chooses or rolls" for the Reckoning type. This is a deliberate ambiguity. For impersonal patrons — abstract forces, indifferent gods, the concept of debt itself — rolling feels right. The Reckoning is mechanical, impersonal, a system correcting itself. For personal patrons — entities with clear personalities, relationships with the character, observable moods — choosing feels right. The Reckoning is a decision made by a character you are playing, and that character would not leave their response to chance.</p>

  <p>Neither approach is more correct. Match the method to the patron.</p>

  <h3>Narrowing</h3>

  <p>The most common Reckoning, and the most interesting. A Narrowing is a contract amendment — the patron is not angry, just <em>precise</em>. They noticed the loophole and they are closing it. This should never feel like a slap. It should feel like receiving a letter from a very attentive attorney. See the section on the Grey for detailed guidance on writing Narrowings.</p>

  <p>Narrowing is also the most forgiving Reckoning, and that is by design. The system wants the Grey to be used. It wants players to push the boundaries. The most common consequence of pushing is that the boundary moves, not that something breaks. This creates a natural rhythm: exploit, narrow, find new angle, exploit again. The game breathes through that cycle.</p>

  <h3>Tithe</h3>

  <p>A Tithe is a quest in miniature. The patron demands something specific — a task, a sacrifice, an offering, an act of service. Until the Tithe is paid, Grant rolls drop by one die. The mechanical pressure is real, but the Tithe itself is the more interesting element. What the patron demands reveals what the patron <em>values</em>, and what the patron values tells the player something about the deal they have made.</p>

  <p>Write Tithes that are specific and narratively rich. "Your patron demands a sacrifice" is vague. "Your patron demands that you return the ring you stole from the temple at Crossing Point — the one you told yourself did not matter" is a scene waiting to happen. The best Tithes connect backward to something the character has already done and force them to reckon with it.</p>

  <p class="example">The Iron Duke demands a Tithe: Kael must defeat a rival champion in single combat and bring the rival's sworn blade to the Duke's altar. The problem: the rival champion is Kael's sister. The Tithe is not the fight. The Tithe is the conversation Kael has to have before the fight, and the one he has to have after.</p>

  <h3>Fraying</h3>

  <p>Fraying is the warning shot. The Grant pool permanently drops by one die until amends are made — and "amends" is whatever the patron decides it means. Fraying should feel like the patron <em>pulling away</em>. The power does not fail dramatically. It simply becomes less reliable, less generous, less present. The patron is still there. They are just not as close as they were.</p>

  <p>Narrate Fraying through the texture of the Grant. The healer's power still works, but it takes longer, hurts more, leaves the patient with a lingering chill. The fire-wielder's flames are dimmer, colder, harder to call. The speaker's words of influence land with less weight — people listen, but they do not feel compelled. The power is withdrawing. The relationship is fraying.</p>

  <p>Amends for Fraying should be significant — harder than a Tithe, more personal. The patron does not want a task completed. The patron wants to know that the relationship still matters. Amends often involve choosing the patron over something the character loves.</p>

  <h3>Severance</h3>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">Severance Is a Story Climax</span>
    Severance — the total breaking of a Contract — should feel like the end of an act, not a random disaster. If the dice produce a 6 on the Reckoning table and the moment does not feel earned — if the story has not built to this, if the relationship between character and patron has not been sufficiently strained — you have permission to downgrade. A Severance that feels arbitrary teaches the player that the system is capricious. A Severance that feels inevitable teaches the player that actions have arcs. Run the one that serves the story.
  </div>

  <p>When Severance does land — when the moment is right, when the tension has built, when the player's eyes say <em>I knew this was coming</em> — give it everything. The power drains. The sigil fades or burns. The world is suddenly quieter, smaller, more ordinary. The character gains a Scar — a visible, permanent mark of the broken deal. And then the character must decide who they are without the power they had.</p>

  <p>Severance is not death. It is transformation. Some of the best Bound stories begin at Severance — the character who must navigate a world of Contracts without one, who carries the mark of a broken deal in a society that reads Scars like criminal records. Play the aftermath. It is rich territory.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Narrowing</strong>: The Goddess of Life amends the Contract after Lysra's bridge argument. Clinical, precise, one clause rewritten. The power continues unchanged. The Grey is tighter.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Tithe</strong>: The Root demands that Sera plant a seed in the ruins of the old temple and tend it until it sprouts — a task that will take weeks, in a place she swore she would never return to. Her Grant dims until the first green appears.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Fraying</strong>: The Burning Glass stops answering Dael's call with its usual ferocity. The light comes, but it is thin, reluctant, like a friend who no longer trusts him. He can still use it. It just does not want to be used.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Severance</strong>: The Iron Duke's sigil on Kael's forearm goes black, then splits. Blood wells in the crack. The cold in his bones — the Duke's constant presence, a weight he had grown accustomed to — vanishes. For the first time in years, his body is his own. It feels like falling. The Scar: a black fissure in his skin, from wrist to elbow, cold to the touch. Everyone who sees it knows what it means.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE VOICE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Voice</span>Playing Patrons</h2>

  <p>Patrons are characters. They are the most important characters in the game, because every player character's identity, power, and drama flows from the relationship with their patron. But they are not people, and the most common mistake GMs make is playing them like people — reasonable, communicative, emotionally legible. Patrons are none of these things.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">They Are Not Human</span>
    A patron does not explain itself. A patron does not negotiate in good faith. A patron does not feel guilt, regret, or sympathy the way a person would. It may <em>simulate</em> these emotions — the Goddess of Life may seem compassionate, the Iron Duke may seem honorable — but beneath the simulation is something older and stranger, something that sees Contracts the way a spider sees a web: as architecture, not as relationship. The moment a patron feels like a person having a reasonable conversation, you have lost the most powerful tool in your kit: the alien weight of the thing on the other end of the deal.
  </div>

  <p>Patrons communicate through the <strong>texture of the power they grant</strong>. When the patron is pleased, the Grant works effortlessly — the fire is warm, the healing is painless, the knowledge arrives whole. When the patron is displeased, the Grant still works but it feels <em>different</em>. The fire is too hot, or too precise. The healing hurts. The knowledge comes with images the character did not ask for. The patron is speaking. The language is the power itself.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Patron's Mood</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Generosity</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The Grant overdelivers. The character asks for a flame and gets a bonfire. The healing seals the wound and warms the blood. The knowledge arrives before the question is fully formed. Narrate this — the player should feel the patron's approval as sensory abundance. This is how the entity says <em>good</em>.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Indifference</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The Grant works exactly as specified, nothing more. This is the default. The power arrives, does what it was contracted to do, and withdraws. No warmth, no cold. The patron is watching but has no opinion about this particular use. This is the baseline you should establish so the other moods have contrast.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Displeasure</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The Grant works, but it carries a flavor of the patron's irritation. The fire smells like burnt offerings. The healing leaves a chill. The knowledge includes a flash of something the character would rather not have seen. No mechanical penalty — yet. This is a signal. The patron is communicating: <em>I noticed. I do not approve. Continue at your peril.</em></span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Warning</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The Grant hesitates before responding. A half-second delay. A flicker before the flame catches. A moment where the character reaches for the power and feels — just for an instant — nothing. Then it arrives, functional but reluctant. This is the last signal before consequences. The patron is saying: <em>the next time, I will not reach back</em>.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>The Sensory Signature</h3>

  <p>Every patron should have a sensory signature — the way their presence <em>feels</em>. Not just visual, but thermal, olfactory, auditory. The Goddess of Life might smell like rain on warm stone. The Iron Duke might carry the taste of iron filings and the sound of distant marching. The Root might feel like cold soil against bare skin and the pressure of something growing beneath you.</p>

  <p>Invoke this signature when the patron is present — when the Grant activates, when a Reckoning arrives, when the character prays or meditates or reaches for the Contract. Consistency is everything. If the patron always smells like rain on warm stone, then the moment the rain smells like <em>something else</em>, the player knows something has changed. Sensory signatures are your most powerful tool for patron characterization without dialogue.</p>

  <h3>Direct Appearances</h3>

  <p>Patron appearances should be rare. Once per campaign arc is about right. When a patron appears directly — in a dream, a vision, a moment of crisis — it should feel like the air has changed in the room. These moments carry weight precisely because they do not happen often. If the patron shows up every other session to comment on the character's choices, the patron becomes a recurring NPC, not a cosmic force. Let the distance do the work.</p>

  <p>When a patron does appear, it should want something. Not something small — something that changes the trajectory of the story. An appearance without purpose is an appearance wasted.</p>

  <p class="example">Sera has been ignoring her patron's signals for weeks — the Grant growing colder, the sensory signature shifting from rich soil to dry dust. She has been pushing her Grey repeatedly, and two Narrowings have tightened the Contract considerably. During a moment of quiet — not a crisis, not a battle, just Sera sitting alone by a fire — the ground beneath her shifts. Not an earthquake. A settling. The Root is <em>here</em>. She can feel it in her teeth, in the soles of her feet, in the way the fire dims to nothing. The Root does not speak. It does not have words. But the pressure beneath her increases until she understands: the next Narrowing will not be a Narrowing. It will be a Tithe. And the Tithe will cost her something she cannot replace. Then the pressure releases. The fire returns. The Root is gone. The scene took ninety seconds and the player will remember it for the entire campaign.</p>

  <!-- THE DEAL -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Deal</span>The Moment of Surrender</h2>

  <p>Desperate Deals are the most dramatic mechanic in Bound. They happen at the edge — when the character has exhausted their options, when the Binding has boxed them in, when the situation is truly, genuinely lost. A player looks at the table and says: <em>I call out to anything that will listen.</em> That sentence should stop the room.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Gravity</span>
    Stop everything. This is the most important scene. Put down the notes, stop tracking initiative if you are in combat, let the background music fade. A Desperate Deal is a character choosing to trade their future for their present. It is surrender and power and tragedy rolled into a single moment. Give it the weight it deserves. Let the silence hold. Let the player feel the full cost of what they are about to do before you tell them what answers.
  </div>

  <h3>What Answers</h3>

  <p>The player does not choose who responds. You do. And the entity that answers should be thematically adjacent to the player's <em>fear</em>, not their hope. If the character is afraid of losing control, the thing that answers offers control — at a price. If the character fears abandonment, the thing that answers promises loyalty — with conditions. The Desperate Deal entity mirrors the character's vulnerability and weaponizes it.</p>

  <p>The entity is never the character's existing patron. The existing patron already has a deal. This is something else — something that was waiting, something that noticed the cry and recognized an opportunity. In the Grind, it might be a subsidiary of a rival Institution. In the Ember, it might be an Echo of something the Sun consumed. In a custom setting, it might be anything powerful enough to hear a soul crack open and hungry enough to reach inside.</p>

  <h3>The Salvation</h3>

  <p>The player describes what they need. It happens. No roll. Total success. This is the bait, and it must be genuinely, unambiguously good. The character is saved. The companion is healed. The enemies are scattered. Whatever the character needed in their moment of desperation, they receive in full. Do not hedge this. Do not add complications to the Salvation itself. The joy is real. The relief is real. What comes later is the price, but the purchase is genuine.</p>

  <h3>Writing Face-Down Bindings</h3>

  <p>The Binding of a Desperate Deal is written face-down — the player does not know the specific restriction until it triggers naturally in play. This is the mechanic's sharpest edge, and it requires the most craft from the GM.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Checklist</span>
    A well-written Desperate Binding is:
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Ironic</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Connected to the moment of desperation. If the character cried out to save a life, the Binding should somehow complicate their relationship with life, death, or the person they saved. The Deal echoes.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Creeping</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Not immediately catastrophic. The Binding should be inconvenient before it becomes devastating. The player should think "I can live with this" before realizing, three sessions later, that they cannot.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Socially Complicated</span>
      <span class="def-desc">It should force strange behavior around other people. A Binding that only matters when the character is alone is a Binding without an audience. The best Desperate Bindings make the character act in ways that their companions notice and question.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Conflicting</span>
      <span class="def-desc">It should contradict an existing Contract. This is the masterwork. A Desperate Binding that makes one of the character's existing oaths impossible to keep creates a slow-motion crisis that the player must eventually resolve by breaking one deal or the other.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>The Reveal</h3>

  <p>Do not reveal the Binding when the player asks. Reveal it when the character would <em>naturally</em> trigger it — when they act in a way that the hidden restriction forbids, and the world responds. This moment should feel like a trap springing, but a trap the character set for themselves by reaching for forbidden power.</p>

  <p>Engineer the situation. Build a scene where the Binding would naturally become relevant. Let the character walk into it. When they take the action that triggers the hidden restriction, flip the card. Read the Binding aloud. Watch the table react. This is one of the most powerful moments the game produces — the dawning realization that the character's salvation was also their cage.</p>

  <p class="example">Three sessions ago, Maren made a Desperate Deal to save her sister from a collapsing building. Something answered — she felt ice in her chest and the building froze in place, stone suspended in midair, her sister pulled free by invisible hands. Tonight, Maren is arguing with a corrupt official. She is angry. She reaches for the words that will expose him — the truth about his dealings, the evidence she has gathered. She opens her mouth and — nothing. The GM turns over the card: "You shall not speak truth to the powerful while the sun is above the horizon." It is midday. The official watches Maren struggle and smiles. He does not understand why she stopped. But Maren understands. She understands exactly what she traded and exactly what she lost.</p>

  <h3>The Spiral</h3>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Spiral</span>
    When a character accumulates three Desperate Deals, the entities confer. This is the endgame — not the end of the campaign, but the end of the character's arc as an independent agent. The entities present a Final Bargain: one Grand Contract with immense Grant and total Binding. The character becomes something between champion and puppet, with power vast enough to reshape the world and restrictions absolute enough to ensure they reshape it in the patrons' image. Plan the Final Bargain in advance. Know what the entities want from this character. Know what the Grand Grant looks like and what the Total Binding demands. The Spiral should feel like a coronation and a funeral held in the same room.
  </div>

  <p>Pace the Deals. A character should not reach three Desperate Deals in three sessions — the escalation needs room to breathe. The first Deal is a crisis. The second Deal, sessions later, is a pattern: the player is learning that their character reaches for forbidden power under pressure. The third Deal is identity — this is who the character is, someone who would rather be bound than defeated. Each Deal should feel heavier than the last. The entities remember. They are not offering rescue. They are making an investment.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE TANGLE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Tangle</span>When Oaths Collide</h2>

  <p>The drama engine of Bound is not Grant versus obstacle. It is Binding versus Binding. When a character carries multiple Contracts — or when a single Binding conflicts with another character's — the game reaches its highest gear. These are the moments the system was built for: the impossible choice between two oaths, where keeping one deal means breaking another.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Dilemma</span>
    When Bindings collide, do not soften the impact. Do not offer a third option that lets the character keep both oaths. Do not provide an easy out. Present the dilemma with absolute clarity — you must break one of these oaths, and each one carries a Reckoning — and then <strong>shut up and wait</strong>. The silence after the dilemma is presented is the most important silence in the game. The player is deciding who their character is. Do not interrupt that process.
  </div>

  <h3>Engineering Collisions</h3>

  <p>Binding conflicts rarely happen by accident. They happen because you see them coming and build scenes that force the issue. The craft is in the timing — too early and the conflict feels manufactured; too late and the players have found workarounds that drain the tension.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Framework</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Identify at character creation</span>
      <span class="def-desc">When players write their Contracts, look at the Bindings. Where could they collide? "You shall not kill" and "you shall not show mercy to the defeated" is an obvious future collision. "You shall speak only truth" and "you shall not reveal the secrets of the deep" is subtler. Mark these on your notes. They are future scenes.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Let workarounds develop</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Players will find ways to avoid the collision. Let them. A character with conflicting Bindings who carefully navigates around the conflict for three sessions is building tension, not avoiding it. The workaround itself is interesting — it shows the player how much effort the character is putting into holding two impossible oaths together.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Then break the workaround</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Build a scene where the careful navigation is no longer possible. The defeated enemy surrenders — directly, unambiguously, in front of witnesses. The secret of the deep is the only truth that will save the companion's life. Remove the escape routes. The player has had time to think about this moment. Now it is here.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Between Characters</h3>

  <p>The richest collisions happen between player characters. When one character's Binding demands an action that another character's Binding forbids, the table is looking at a scene that no amount of GM planning could have scripted. These conflicts are gifts — step back and let the players negotiate, argue, plead, and ultimately choose. Your job is to present the situation clearly and then get out of the way.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Contracts as Complexity</h3>

  <p>When a character forges a second or third Contract, they are not increasing their power — they are increasing their <em>complexity</em>. Each new Binding is a new axis of restriction. Each new Grant is a new domain that might conflict with existing obligations. A character with three Contracts is not three times as powerful as a character with one. They are three times as <em>constrained</em>, with three times as many ways for the world to make them choose.</p>

  <p class="example">Voss carries two Contracts. The first, with the Archive, demands: "You shall preserve every document you encounter." The second, with the Burning Glass, demands: "You shall destroy what hides in shadow." She has been managing this for six sessions — the Archive's documents are not in shadow, the Burning Glass's targets are not documents. Then the GM presents a library full of forbidden texts, locked in a vault beneath the city, sealed in darkness for a century. Every book is a document. Every book is in shadow. Both Bindings activate. Both cannot be obeyed. Voss's player stares at the table for a full thirty seconds before speaking. That thirty seconds is the best scene of the campaign.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE RHYTHM -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Rhythm</span>The Shape of a Session</h2>

  <p>A session of Bound should have a shape — not a rigid structure, but a discernible arc that the players can feel even if they cannot name it. Tension builds, a pivotal Contract moment arrives, consequences unfold. Not every session will hit this arc perfectly. But if you build toward it, the sessions that land will land hard.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Shape</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Opening</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Begin in the aftermath of the last session or in a moment of relative calm. Restate the situation. Let the players breathe. If a setting has an opening ritual (the Grind's Overhead question, the Ember's Crossings), use it. Otherwise, start with a simple question: "Where are you, and what are you doing?" Human-scale, grounded. The calm before.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Road</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The situation develops. New information arrives. The Contracts become relevant — a Grant is needed, a Binding complicates things, the Grey is tempting. This is the longest section of the session. It should alternate between scenes where the Contracts matter and scenes where the characters are just <em>people</em> — talking, resting, arguing about the route. The human scenes give the Contract scenes their weight.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Pivot</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The moment the session has been building toward. A Binding collision. A Grey exploit with real stakes. A Reckoning. A Desperate Deal. Not every session will have a single clear pivot, but the best ones do — a scene the table will remember, where a character had to make a choice that changed something permanently.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Fallout</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The consequences of the Pivot, immediate and social. How do the other characters react? What changed in the world? What new Bindings or Narrowings are in play? The Fallout should be shorter than the Road but never skipped — it is where the players process what just happened.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Close</span>
      <span class="def-desc">End on a beat, not in the middle of action. A closing image. A question left unanswered. A character alone with the weight of what they have done. If a setting has a closing ritual, use it. Otherwise, find the moment where the session naturally exhales. That is your ending.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Scene Framing</h3>

  <p>Cut to scenes where Contracts are relevant. Cut away from scenes where nothing is at stake. This is the most important pacing skill in Bound — the discipline to skip the parts where nothing interesting is happening and drop the players directly into the moment where a choice must be made.</p>

  <p>Not every scene needs to involve a Contract. Scenes of human connection — sharing a meal, arguing about philosophy, grieving a loss — are essential. They provide the emotional foundation that makes the Contract scenes matter. But scenes where the characters are simply traveling, searching empty rooms, or waiting for something to happen should be narrated in a sentence and moved past.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Cut</span>
    When in doubt, cut. Cut to the next scene. Cut away from the current scene if the tension has peaked. Cut <em>into</em> a scene already in progress. Bound is not a game of continuous time — it is a game of <em>moments</em>, strung together by implication. If you can cut from the planning scene to the moment the plan goes wrong, do it. If you can cut from the argument to the next morning when the silence between the characters says more than the argument did, do it. The space between scenes is where the players' imaginations work hardest. Give them that space.
  </div>

  <p>Alternate Contract pressure scenes with human connection scenes. The rhythm should feel like breathing — inhale (pressure, choices, consequences) and exhale (rest, connection, reflection). Three Contract scenes in a row is exhausting. Three human scenes in a row loses momentum. Find the rhythm for your table. It will be different every session.</p>

  <h3>Rolls Per Session</h3>

  <p>Aim for three to six significant rolls per session. If you are averaging more, you are rolling too often — go back to the Silence section and apply the test. If you are averaging fewer, you may not be presenting enough situations where the outcome is both uncertain and interesting. Three to six is the range where each roll carries weight and the session has enough mechanical texture to feel like a game, not a freeform narrative exercise.</p>

  <p class="example">Session arc: The session opens with the party breaking camp in the Waste. Sera asks about the road ahead (human scene — no roll, just information). They encounter a merchant whose cart has broken down — Kael uses his Grant to fix the wheel (no roll — low stakes, Grant clearly covers it, fiction carries). The merchant warns them about something blocking the road ahead. Cut to: the blockade. Maren's Binding ("you shall not retreat from a direct challenge") makes going around impossible. First significant roll — Voss tries to negotiate passage. 3–4: compromise. They can pass, but only if they leave their supplies. Second roll — Sera exploits her Grey to sense what is really behind the blockade. Arbiter Die comes up lower than her dice: no Reckoning, but the information is troubling. The Pivot: what Sera learned means that Kael's Binding is about to become relevant, and he does not know it yet. Third roll — Kael acts, not knowing what Sera knows. Sera's Binding says she cannot tell him. The Fallout: consequences of Kael's action, Sera's guilt, the party reckoning with what happened. The Close: Kael sitting alone, looking at his hands. Sera watching him from across the fire, unable to speak. Three significant rolls. One of the best sessions the table has played.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE CONTRACTED WORLD -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Contracted World</span>Everyone Has a Deal</h2>

  <p>The world of Bound runs on Contracts — not just the player characters' Contracts, but everyone's. The guard at the gate has a deal: she keeps her post, she gets paid, she feeds her family. The merchant on the corner has a deal: honest weights mean honest customers. The king on the throne has the oldest deal of all: power in exchange for the burden of wielding it. These are not magical Contracts with cosmic patrons. They are the deals that hold a society together — agreements, promises, obligations, debts.</p>

  <p>When you build the world this way, the player characters' Contracts stop being exceptional and start being <em>visible</em>. Everyone is bound. The PCs are just bound to something louder.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">No Villains</span>
    The horror of Bound is systemic, not personal. The antagonist is not evil — they are bound by deals as restrictive as the players', pursuing goals as understandable as the players', trapped by oaths as inescapable as the players'. Sympathy extends to everyone in this world, because everyone is navigating the same impossible architecture of obligation and desire. The most terrifying antagonist is the one whose position the players understand — the one whose choices they recognize as the choices they might have made, given different Bindings.
  </div>

  <h3>Quick NPC Contracts</h3>

  <p>You do not need a full character sheet for every NPC. You need three sentences.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Quick Contract</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Name and Want</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Who is this person and what are they trying to achieve? Not their personality — their <em>goal</em>. The guard wants to make it through her shift without incident. The merchant wants to close one more deal before sunset. The priest wants to keep his congregation from learning what he found in the basement.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Can't</span>
      <span class="def-desc">What is this person's restriction? What oath, obligation, or fear keeps them from simply taking what they want? The guard can't leave her post. The merchant can't sell below cost or his suppliers will cut him off. The priest can't tell anyone what he found because his vows forbid speaking of the unsanctified.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Loophole</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Where does this person's restriction bend? What workaround have they found, or what workaround might they accept? The guard could be "called away" by a convincing distraction. The merchant might "gift" an item to someone who then owes a favor. The priest might show someone the basement and let them draw their own conclusions. The loophole is where the player characters enter the equation.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This template turns every NPC interaction into a potential Contract negotiation. The players are not just talking to a guard — they are identifying the guard's Want, her Can't, and her Loophole, and then deciding whether to exploit it. Social encounters in Bound are puzzle pieces built from the same logic as the player characters' Contracts.</p>

  <h3>Mirror Characters</h3>

  <p>The most powerful type of antagonist in Bound is the mirror — a character with the same domain as a player character, but different Binding, different Grey. The mirror shows the player what they could become. A healer who serves the same goddess but whose Binding says "you shall not withhold your power from anyone who asks" — including the people who are using the healing to continue doing terrible things. A fire-wielder whose Grey is wider than the PC's, who uses the loophole without hesitation and has not yet faced the Reckoning for it.</p>

  <p>Mirror characters do not need to be villains. They do not even need to be antagonists. They just need to exist — to show the player a version of their Contract that went differently. The player will do the rest.</p>

  <p class="example">Captain Aldren serves the same patron as Kael — the Iron Duke. Same domain: war, duty, the defense of the old borders. But Aldren's Binding is different: "You shall not question an order from above." Kael's Binding says "You shall not raise steel against the unarmed." When Aldren receives orders to clear a village of suspected spies, he does it without hesitation. He cannot question. When Kael sees the aftermath — unarmed people, steel already raised — he cannot participate. Same patron. Same power. Two different cages. Kael looks at Aldren and sees the version of himself that traded a different freedom for the same Grant.</p>


  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <!-- THE ENDING -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Ending</span>How Stories Close in Bound</h2>

  <p>Campaigns in Bound do not end with the defeat of a villain or the resolution of a plot. They end with the resolution of <em>Contracts</em>. The story is about the deals, and the ending is about what happens to them — honored, broken, renegotiated, or abandoned. When you feel a campaign approaching its end, look at the Contracts, not the plot. The plot is the vehicle. The Contracts are the destination.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Four Endings</span>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Severance</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The break. The character's relationship with their patron reaches its limit — through accumulated Reckonings, a catastrophic violation, or a deliberate choice to defy the Contract one final time. The power drains. The Scar forms. The character walks away diminished but free. Severance is an ending about the cost of independence.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Renegotiation</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Hard-won peace. The character returns to their patron and negotiates a new deal — one that reflects who they have become, not who they were when they signed. The Grant may narrow. The Binding may soften. The Grey may be rewritten entirely. Renegotiation is an ending about growth — the character is no longer the person who made the original deal, and the deal changes to match.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Spiral</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The Final Bargain. Three Desperate Deals have culminated in a Grand Contract — immense power, total restriction. The character becomes something more than human and less than free. The Spiral is an ending about the price of ambition — the character who kept reaching for more power until the power reached back.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">Walking Away</span>
      <span class="def-desc">The bravest ending. The character chooses to live without a Contract — no Grant, no Binding, no Grey. They return to being ordinary. In a world where power comes from deals, choosing powerlessness is its own form of rebellion. Walking Away is an ending about the dignity of being unbound.</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Signaling the End</h3>

  <p>Signal the ending in advance. A Severance should be anticipated — the player should feel the relationship fraying over multiple sessions. A Renegotiation should emerge from the character's arc — the player should recognize that their character has changed enough that the old Contract no longer fits. A Spiral should build through three distinct Desperate Deals, each separated by enough play to feel like a chapter. Walking Away should follow a moment of clarity — the character seeing, for the first time, what life looks like without the weight of the Contract.</p>

  <p>Do not spring an ending on a player. The most powerful endings are the ones the player sees coming and walks toward anyway.</p>

  <h3>The Epilogue</h3>

  <p>After the Contract resolves, play one more scene. Not a scene of power or drama or consequence. A scene of <em>life</em>. Show the person after the power is gone or transformed. Show them doing something mundane — cooking a meal, walking a road, sitting in a quiet room. Show who they are when the Contract is no longer the defining fact of their existence.</p>

  <p>These scenes are short. A few lines of narration, a single exchange of dialogue, a closing image. They are also the most important scenes in the campaign, because they answer the only question that matters: who is this person, underneath?</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Last Scene</span>
    The final scene of a Bound campaign should be mundane, personal, and human. Not a battle. Not a cosmic revelation. Not a grand speech. A person, alone or with someone they love, doing something small. The smaller the better. After everything — the Grants and the Bindings and the Reckonings and the Desperate Deals — the last image should be a human being, living. That is what the game was about all along.
  </div>

  <p class="example"><strong>Severance</strong>: Lysra breaks her Contract with the Goddess of Life by choosing to let a tyrant die rather than heal him. The power drains from her hands. The Scar blooms across her palms — a web of white lines where the healing used to live. Epilogue: six months later, Lysra runs a clinic in a border town. She uses herbs now, and patience, and the knowledge she gained when she could feel the architecture of a human body. She is slower. She is mortal. She is, for the first time in years, making choices that are entirely her own.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Renegotiation</strong>: Kael returns to the Iron Duke's altar and kneels. He speaks the new terms aloud: a narrower Grant — defense only, never aggression — and a Binding that reflects his growth: "You shall not raise steel except to shield those who cannot shield themselves." The Duke considers. The cold deepens, then eases. The deal is struck. Epilogue: Kael stands at a border crossing, his blade sheathed. A column of refugees approaches. He steps aside and lets them pass. This is the Grant now. This is enough.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>The Spiral</strong>: Maren accepts the Final Bargain. The three entities speak through her simultaneously — her eyes change, her voice harmonizes with itself. The Grand Grant: she can rewrite any Contract she witnesses. The Total Binding: she may never forge a relationship that is not contractual. Epilogue: Maren walks through the city, and the Contracts glow visible to her — every oath, every debt, every promise. She can see the web that holds the world together. She can adjust any thread. She reaches out and tightens a fraying marriage bond between two strangers. They will not know why they suddenly felt something shift between them. Maren keeps walking. She has work to do.</p>

  <p class="example"><strong>Walking Away</strong>: Sera goes to the place where the Root grows deepest and kneels in the dark soil. She tells the Root — not asks, tells — that the deal is done. She offers no renegotiation, no new terms. She simply stops. The power drains from her like water into earth. The sensory signature fades — the smell of cold soil, the pressure beneath her feet, the sound of growing things — until there is nothing left but a woman kneeling in the dirt. Epilogue: Sera plants a garden. An ordinary garden, with ordinary seeds, watered by hand. Nothing grows faster than it should. Nothing whispers when she touches the soil. She is the most ordinary person in the world, and she chose to be, and that choice is the bravest thing she has ever done.</p>

  <!-- THE TRUST -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Trust</span>A Note on the Game Beneath the Game</h2>

  <p>Everything in this document — the mechanics, the craft, the pacing, the philosophy — rests on a single foundation: <strong>trust</strong>. The Grey works only if both sides play it honestly. The player must genuinely believe that their interpretation might not hold. The GM must genuinely believe that the player's argument deserves consideration. The Arbiter Die must feel like a response, not a veto. None of this is possible without trust.</p>

  <p>The social contract at your table mirrors the fictional Contracts in the game. You, the GM, have a Grant — the authority to build the world, play the patrons, adjudicate the dice. You have a Binding — the obligation to be fair, to be honest, to present consequences rather than punishments. You have a Grey — the space where your judgment operates, where the rules do not specify and your instincts guide you. The players have the same architecture: the Grant of creating characters and making choices, the Binding of engaging honestly with the fiction, the Grey of interpretation and creativity.</p>

  <p>When both sides honor their deals — when the GM enforces the Contracts without malice and the players exploit the Grey without cynicism — the game sings. When trust breaks, the game breaks with it. No mechanic can repair a table where the GM is seen as an adversary or the players are seen as problems to be managed. The trust comes first. Everything else follows.</p>

    <span class="clause-label">The Final Contract</span>
    You hold the Contracts. All of them — the Grants and the Bindings and the Greys and the Desperate Deals written face-down in your notebook. You hold the Reckonings that have not yet arrived and the Severances that might never come. You hold the world, and the patrons who haunt it, and the weight of every deal that was ever struck at your table.<br><br>

    You also hold the people. The ones who wrote those Contracts, who care about the characters bound by them, who lean forward when the Arbiter Die hits the table. They trust you — with their stories, their choices, their willingness to be vulnerable in front of other people for the sake of a fiction about oaths and loopholes.<br><br>

    Honor both. Enforce the deals. Love the people who signed them. Present consequences that feel true and complications that feel fair and dilemmas that feel impossible and endings that feel earned. When a character reaches for the Grey, let yourself feel that stir — the one where you do not know how this will go, where the patron is watching, where the dice could change everything.<br><br>

    That is the deal. That is your Contract. There is no Grey in it, and there does not need to be.<br><br>

    Go run the game.
