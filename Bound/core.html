  </div>

  <!-- SECTION I -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section I</span>The Contract</h2>

  <p>In <strong>Bound</strong>, every player character draws their power from <strong>Contracts</strong> — binding agreements forged with powerful entities. Gods, spirits, fey lords, eldritch intelligences, or abstract forces of the universe itself. Power is never free. Every gift comes with a leash.</p>

  <p>Each Contract has three parts:</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Grant</span>
    What the Contract gives you. A domain of power — something you can do that ordinary people cannot. Heal wounds. Command fire. Walk unseen. Speak with the dead.
  </div>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Binding</span>
    What the Contract demands. A restrictions on your behavior — something you <em>cannot do</em> or <em>must do</em>, always. You shall not take a life. You must speak truth. You shall not refuse a plea for help.
  </div>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Grey</span>
    The loophole. A clause in the Contract with deliberate ambiguity — a gap in the wording that you, the player, define at character creation. This is your room to maneuver, your space for creative interpretation. "By your hand or will" leaves indirect causation undefined. "Speak truth" says nothing about <em>selective</em> truth. The Grey is yours. Guard it.
  </div>

  <p class="example">Lysra's Contract with the Goddess of Life — Grant: heal wounds, cure disease, sense living things, bolster vitality. Binding: you shall not take a life by your hand or will. Grey: "by your hand or will" — does gravity count? Does negligence?</p>


  <!-- SECTION II -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section II</span>Resolution</h2>

  <p>When the outcome of an action is uncertain, roll <strong>six-sided dice</strong>. The number of dice you roll depends on how your action relates to your Contracts.</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Situation</th><th>Dice</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>Within your Grant</strong> — using your contracted power</td><td>Roll 3d6, take highest</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Mundane action</strong> — outside any Contract</td><td>Roll 2d6, take highest</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Against your Binding</strong> — violating your oath</td><td>Roll 1d6</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Exploiting the Grey</strong> — see below</td><td>Roll 2d6, GM rolls Arbiter Die</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Read the highest die result:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Result</th><th>Outcome</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>5 – 6</strong></td><td>Full success. You achieve what you intended.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>3 – 4</strong></td><td>Partial success. You get what you want, but with a complication, cost, or compromise.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1 – 2</strong></td><td>Failure. Things go wrong, and there may be consequences.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

  <h3>The Arbiter Die</h3>

  <p>When you exploit the Grey — acting in the ambiguous space of your Contract — roll 2d6 as normal, but the GM simultaneously rolls <strong>1d6: the Arbiter Die</strong>. If the Arbiter Die is higher than <em>both</em> of your dice, a <strong>Reckoning</strong> occurs. Your patron noticed. Your patron has opinions.</p>

  <p>Resolve the action normally based on your highest die, then apply the Reckoning.</p>


  <!-- SECTION III -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section III</span>Reckoning</h2>

  <p>When you push the Grey too far or act directly against a Binding, your patron responds. The GM chooses or rolls for the consequence:</p>

  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">1–2 · Narrowing</span>
    <span class="def-desc">Your patron <em>clarifies</em> the contract. The Grey is rewritten — tighter, more specific. The loophole you exploited is closed. Write the new wording together.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">3–4 · Tithe</span>
    <span class="def-desc">Your patron demands something in return. A quest, a sacrifice, a memory, a promise. Until you pay, your Grant rolls drop by one die.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">5 · Fraying</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The Contract weakens. Your Grant pool permanently drops by one die (to a minimum of 1d6) until you make amends on your patron's terms.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">6 · Severance</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The Contract is broken. You lose all powers granted by this patron and gain a <strong>Scar</strong> — a permanent, visible mark of the broken deal. Scars are narrative; work with the GM to define yours.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The beauty of Narrowing is that the system self-corrects. The more a player exploits ambiguity, the less ambiguity remains. The Grey is a finite resource that regenerates only through renegotiation.</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
  <!-- SECTION IV -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section IV</span>Growth &amp; Renegotiation</h2>

  <p>There are no levels in <strong>Bound</strong>. Characters grow by <strong>renegotiating</strong> existing Contracts or <strong>forging</strong> new ones. This always happens in fiction — you must seek your patron (or a new one) and bargain in person.</p>

  <p>Renegotiation follows the logic of the deal. Nothing is free:</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Terms of Renegotiation</span>
    A broader Grant demands a harsher Binding. A looser Binding demands a narrower Grant. A new Grey clause costs a Tithe paid up front. Every change must be agreed upon in-fiction between character and patron.
  </div>

  <h3>Multiple Contracts</h3>

  <p>Characters may forge Contracts with more than one patron. Each is tracked separately with its own Grant, Binding, and Grey. The danger — and the drama — emerges when Bindings <em>conflict</em>.</p>

  <p class="example">Your Contract with the Goddess of Life says "do not kill." Your Contract with the Iron Duke says "never show mercy to the defeated." Someone surrenders. What do you do?</p>

  <p>When Bindings conflict, you must break one oath to keep another. Reckoning follows accordingly. Choose wisely.</p>

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>
  <!-- SECTION V -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section V</span>Desperate Deals</h2>

  <p>When all seems lost, any player may cry out and make a <strong>Desperate Deal</strong>. There is no mechanical trigger — it is a narrative declaration, a moment of surrender:</p>

  <p class="example">"I call out to anything that will listen."</p>

  <p><strong>You do not choose who answers.</strong> The GM decides what entity arrives, and it is never the patron you would want. The Goddess of Life does not answer desperate pleas. Something hungrier does.</p>

  <h3>The Salvation</h3>

  <p>Describe what you need to happen <em>right now</em>. It happens. No roll. Automatic, total success at whatever you were attempting. This is the bait.</p>

  <h3>The Price</h3>

  <p>The GM writes the Binding — but writes it <strong>face-down</strong>. The player knows the broad shape of the deal ("you owe the Hollow King a debt") but the specific restriction reveals itself only when they would first naturally trigger it in play.</p>

  <p class="example">You made a Desperate Deal with the Whispering Court to survive a collapsing temple. Three sessions later, you try to lie to an NPC and the GM flips the card: "You shall speak no falsehood while the moon is visible." It is nighttime. It has been nighttime a lot lately.</p>

  <h3>The Structure of a Desperate Contract</h3>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">What Makes It Desperate</span>
    The Grant is narrow — one miracle, already spent. The Binding is harsh and often thematically ironic. And crucially: <strong>there is no Grey.</strong> You had no time to negotiate loopholes. The only paths forward are to <em>obey</em>, <em>violate and face Reckoning</em>, or fulfill the <em>Escape Clause</em>.
  </div>

  <h3>The Escape Clause</h3>

  <p>Every Desperate Deal has one way out — but the patron sets the terms. A quest, a betrayal, a sacrifice of something dear. The GM reveals the Escape Clause when it is dramatically appropriate, not necessarily when the player asks.</p>

  <h3>Stacking</h3>

  <p>Desperate Deals do not replace existing Contracts. They accumulate. A reckless character may carry a negotiated Contract <em>and</em> two or three Desperate Deals, each with its own Binding, each without a Grey. Every action becomes a minefield of overlapping restrictions — a character who is powerful but increasingly trapped.</p>

  <h3>The Spiral</h3>

  <p><em>Optional rule.</em> If a character accumulates <strong>three Desperate Deals</strong>, the entities begin to confer. They collectively present a <strong>Final Bargain</strong> — one Grand Contract that consolidates everything. The Grant is immense. The Binding is total. The character becomes something between a champion and a puppet. This is the endgame for those who leaned too hard on borrowed power.</p>

  <h3>Writing Good Desperate Bindings</h3>

  <p>Guidance for the GM — the best Desperate Bindings are <strong>ironic</strong> (connected to the moment of weakness), <strong>creeping</strong> (not immediately catastrophic but increasingly inconvenient), <strong>socially complicated</strong> (forcing strange behavior around others), and <strong>conflicting</strong> (contradicting an existing Contract so the player must eventually break one oath to keep another).</p>

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>
  <!-- SECTION VI -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Section VI</span>Character Creation</h2>

  <p>A character in <strong>Bound</strong> fits on an index card. Follow these steps:</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Rite of Drafting</span>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Name your Patron</strong> — and the domain they represent.</li>
      <li><strong>Write the Grant</strong> — three or four things your Contract empowers you to do.</li>
      <li><strong>Write the Binding</strong> — one or two things you cannot do, or must always do.</li>
      <li><strong>Write the Grey</strong> — one clause with deliberate, exploitable ambiguity.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose three mundane skills</strong> — things you can do that have nothing to do with your Contract. Fighting, sneaking, persuading, crafting, sailing, cooking — anything that grounds you as a person beyond your power.</li>
      <li><strong>Name yourself.</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>That is all you need. Play begins when the ink dries.</p>
