  <!-- THE WORLD -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The World</span>The City That Feeds</h2>

  <p>The City has no name that matters. Every city is this city. It is a place of concrete and fluorescent light, of payday loan storefronts and glass towers that reflect nothing back, of algorithms that know your spending habits and entities that know your soul. Magic is real here, but it doesn't look like magic. It looks like a promotion you can't refuse, a subscription you can't cancel, a loyalty program that tracks more than your purchases.</p>

  <p>The entities that offer Contracts are not ancient gods. They are <strong>Institutions</strong> — vast, ambient, systemic forces that have existed long enough to develop hunger and will. They wear the faces of corporations, bureaucracies, landlords, platforms, and markets. They are not metaphors for capitalism. They <em>are</em> capitalism, in the same way that a hurricane is not a metaphor for wind.</p>

  <p>Every person in the City has at least one Contract, whether they know it or not. Most have several. The rent is a Binding. The terms of service are a Binding. The expectation that you smile at customers who demean you is a Binding. Power flows upward. Restriction flows down.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Central Horror</span>
    The Contracts in the Grind are not designed to empower you. They are designed to <strong>use you until you are used up</strong>, then release you into a mundane life with nothing — no power, no leverage, no capacity to resist those who still hold Contracts above you. The system doesn't need to kill you. It just needs you too tired to fight.
  </div>

  <h3>The Shape of Power</h3>

  <p>In the Grind, the people at the top are not more powerful because they have better Contracts. They are more powerful because <strong>they hold the Contracts that bind others</strong>. A middle manager's Grant comes from their employer-patron, but their Binding restricts them from organizing, from dissent, from rest. The CEO's Contract has a much gentler Binding — because the system was designed by entities that reward those who feed them.</p>

  <p>Player characters are people who have enough power to be dangerous but not enough to be comfortable. They can see the machinery. They just can't stop it from grinding.</p>

  <div class="def">

    <span class="def-desc">The endgame isn't death. It's powerlessness. Becoming just another person who can't afford to fight, can't afford to leave, can't afford to care. The Institutions don't need to destroy you. They just need you to stop being a problem.</span>
  </div>


  <!-- SETTING RULES -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Setting Rules</span>The Fine Print</h2>

  <h3>Mundane Gravity</h3>

  <p>In the Grind, the default state is not adventure — it is <strong>maintenance</strong>. Characters have rent, bills, obligations, and jobs. At the start of each session (or each in-game week, at the GM's discretion), every character must account for their <strong>Overhead</strong>: the mundane Bindings that keep them functional in the City. If they cannot meet Overhead, they face a choice: take on a new Contract to cover the gap, or let something in their life collapse.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">Overhead</span>
    Overhead is not a detailed accounting exercise. It is a single narrative question the GM asks at the start of each session: <em>"How are you keeping the lights on?"</em> If the answer requires a Contract or a compromise, play that out. If the character has it handled, move on. The point is to make the economic pressure <strong>felt</strong>, not to simulate a budget spreadsheet.
  </div>

  <h3>The Burnout Track</h3>

  <p>Every character has a <strong>Burnout Track</strong> with five boxes. You mark a box when:</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Burnout Triggers</span>
    <ol>
      <li>You take on a new Contract or Desperate Deal under economic pressure.</li>
      <li>A Reckoning results in Narrowing or Tithe and you cannot pay.</li>
      <li>You act against your own values to fulfill a Binding — and the table agrees it cost you something real.</li>
      <li>You fail to meet Overhead and lose something that mattered (an apartment, a relationship, a sense of safety).</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>When you mark your <strong>third box</strong>, all mundane rolls drop to 1d6. You're exhausted. You're surviving, not living. When you mark your <strong>fifth box</strong>, your character <strong>Burns Out</strong>. All Contracts are Severed — not dramatically, not with fire and fury, but quietly. The entities stop answering. Your power drains away over a week like a subscription lapsing. You are mundane now. You are free, in the way that a person with nothing is free.</p>

  <p>A Burned Out character can still appear in the story, but they cannot fight the Institutions. They are a cautionary tale, a friend who tells you to stop, a face you recognize on the bus that used to mean something. The player may retire this character and create a new one, or play the Burned Out character as someone trying to rebuild a life from nothing.</p>

  <h3>Clearing Burnout</h3>

  <p>You can erase one Burnout box through genuine human connection that the Institutions cannot commodify. The table decides together what qualifies, but it should be <strong>specific and vulnerable</strong>: not "we hang out" but "I tell Marcus about the thing I did to get promoted and he doesn't leave." This is the mechanical teeth behind the solidarity theme. <em>Other people are how you survive.</em></p>

  <h3>Collective Action</h3>

  <p>When two or more players act together against the same Institution, they don't just combine dice — they invoke a <strong>Collective Action</strong>. Each participating player rolls their normal pool. Take the single highest die across all pools, <em>then add +1</em>. A result of 7 is treated as a 6, but with an additional narrative benefit: the Institution <strong>notices the pattern</strong> and is, for the first time, <em>concerned</em>.</p>

  <p>Collective Action cannot be used to exploit the Grey. It only works for direct, overt resistance. The loopholes are individual; the defiance is shared.</p>


  <!-- THE INSTITUTIONS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Institutions</span>Patrons of the Grind</h2>

  <p>The following are the major Institutions that offer Contracts in the City. They are not the only ones — the Grind breeds new parasites constantly — but they are the most entrenched. Each Institution offers multiple Grants and Bindings — a player chooses <strong>one Grant</strong> and <strong>one Binding</strong> from their patron's list, then writes their own Grey. Two characters contracted to the same Institution may have very different powers and very different chains. The examples below are not exhaustive; players and GMs are encouraged to invent new options that fit the Institution's domain.</p>

  <!-- PATRON 1 -->
  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Firm</div>
    <div class="patron-title">Institution of Labor &amp; Obligation</div>

    <p>The Firm is the entity that lives in the relationship between employer and employed. It is not any single company. It is the <em>principle</em> of your time belonging to someone else. It smells like recycled office air and tastes like cold coffee at 6 PM on a Friday. Its sigil is the timesheet. Its temples are open-plan offices with motivational posters about teamwork.</p>

    <div class="patron-title">Institution of Debt &amp; Currency</div>

    <p>The Ledger is the entity that lives in the gap between what you have and what you owe. It predates money — it was born the first time one human said "you owe me" to another. In the modern City, it has grown vast and patient. Its sigil is the credit score. Its temples are banks, payday lenders, and the notification on your phone that says <em>payment due</em>.</p>

Doors don't open. You are outside the economy.</div>

  <!-- DESPERATE DEALS IN THE GRIND -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Desperate Deals</span>Who Answers in the Grind</h2>

  <p>When a player makes a Desperate Deal in the Grind, the entity that answers is not a new Institution. It is a <strong>subsidiary</strong> — a smaller, hungrier arm of an existing Institution, or a parasitic entity that feeds on the gaps between Institutions. They have names like <em>QuickCash</em>, <em>HealthNow</em>, <em>GigFlex</em>, and <em>TrustVerify</em>. They sound helpful. They are not.</p>

  <p>The GM should choose (or invent) a subsidiary that thematically mirrors whatever the player was desperate about. Couldn't pay rent? <em>LendBridge</em> answers — a subsidiary of the Ledger that specializes in people with no collateral left except their future. Need information you're not supposed to have? <em>DeepIndex</em> answers — a subsidiary of the Credential that trades in unauthorized knowledge and charges in memories.</p>

  <div class="clause concrete">
    <span class="clause-label">The Gig Economy of the Soul</span>
    Desperate Deals in the Grind feel like signing up for a new app at 2 AM because you need the money by Friday. The interface is friendly. The terms are long. The confirmation button says "I agree" and you press it because what choice do you have. Three weeks later you discover you've agreed to something that restructures your entire life, and the unsubscribe link is broken.
  </div>


  <!-- FALSE EXITS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">False Exits</span>The Deals That Look Like Freedom</h2>

  <p>Not every Desperate Deal in the Grind comes from a subsidiary. Some come from something worse: entities that wear the <em>mask</em> of liberation. They appear when a character is not just desperate but <strong>defiant</strong> — when the cry is not "help me survive" but "help me <em>escape</em>." These are the <strong>False Exits</strong>.</p>

  <p>A False Exit does not look like another chain. It looks like the key. A windfall. A shortcut. A way out that the Institutions don't want you to know about. It feels like rebellion. It tastes like freedom. And it feeds the system more than compliance ever could — because the system's greatest trick is selling you the exit door that leads back to the lobby.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Mechanism</span>
    A False Exit functions like a Desperate Deal with one critical difference: the <strong>Salvation is real and ongoing</strong>. It is not a single miracle already spent — it is a genuine, persistent power that <em>appears</em> to operate outside the Institutions. The player receives something that feels like escape. The catch is that the Binding doesn't just restrict them — it <strong>redirects their energy back into the system</strong> through a different intake valve. They are not freed. They are rerouted.
  </div>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>

  <p>A False Exit triggers the same way as a Desperate Deal — a player cries out — but the GM should offer it specifically when a character is acting out of <strong>defiance rather than desperation</strong>. The distinction matters. A Desperate Deal is "I'll do anything to survive." A False Exit is "I'll do anything to get <em>out</em>."</p>

  <p>Like a Desperate Deal, the full Binding is written face-down and revealed in play. Unlike a Desperate Deal, the Grant is not a one-time miracle — it persists, and it genuinely works. This is what makes False Exits so dangerous. The power is real. The freedom is not.</p>

  <p>And like Desperate Deals: <strong>there is no Grey</strong>. You didn't negotiate. You just took the hand that was offered.</p>

  <h3>The Redirect</h3>

  <p>Every False Exit Binding contains a <strong>Redirect</strong> — a behavioral compulsion that transforms the character's defiance into fuel for the very system they were trying to escape. The player doesn't just lose freedom. They become an <em>advertisement</em> for the system, a cautionary tale that reinforces the message: there is no way out, so you might as well comply.</p>

  <p>The best Redirects are invisible to the character at first. They feel like personal choices, natural consequences, earned habits. By the time the player recognizes the pattern, they've already been feeding the machine for weeks.</p>

    <div class="patron-name">The Lottery</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Ledger</div>

    <p>A massive windfall. Not earned, not borrowed — <em>won</em>. Enough money to pay off every debt, break every Contract with the Ledger, and walk away clean. It arrives in your account overnight. It is real. It spends. For the first time in your life, you do not owe.</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Financial invulnerability. You always have enough. Not "just enough" like the Float — genuinely, absurdly enough. Rent is nothing. Debts evaporate. You can buy your way out of problems that used to crush you.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> Every gamble calls to you. Not just casinos — every risk that has a payout. Investments, bets, deals, schemes. You cannot refuse an opportunity to turn money into more money. And the wins keep coming, at first. They always do, at first.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Your spending drives markets. Your gambling funds the house. Your "freedom money" circulates back into the Ledger's economy faster than you can spend it. You are not free of the system — you are its most efficient engine. Every dollar you throw around creates ten new debts for someone else. You are the proof that the Ledger rewards the faithful, and everyone who sees your luck doubles down on their own Contracts.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Lottery's Escape Clause is the hardest kind: give it all away. Not strategically, not as investment, not as debt creation — genuinely, freely, with nothing owed in return. The one thing the Binding makes almost impossible to do.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Hustle</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Firm</div>

    <p>Independence. You quit. Not in a blaze of glory — you just stop answering to the hierarchy. Your own hours, your own projects, your own name on the door. The Firm's Bindings fall away like a bad dream. You are, for the first time, your own boss.</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Self-sovereignty. No hierarchy has authority over you. Persuasion that worked on you as an employee now slides off like water. You can see the Firm's chains on others with perfect clarity, and your mere presence weakens those chains. People around you start questioning their own Bindings.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> You cannot stop working. Not for the Firm — for yourself. Every waking moment must be productive, monetized, optimized. Rest is waste. Sleep is a luxury. Vacation is a word for people who don't want it enough. You are free from the Firm's clock, and you have replaced it with one that never stops.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You become the Firm's best recruiter. Every person who sees you "free" and "thriving" and "doing what you love" internalizes the message: the problem was never the system, it was that you weren't working hard enough <em>for yourself</em>. Your visible grind glorifies labor. Your exhaustion looks like passion. People sign harder Contracts with the Firm because they think they just need to hustle their way out like you did. You haven't escaped. You've become the brochure.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Hustle's Escape Clause: do nothing. A full day — sunrise to sunrise — of deliberate, chosen, unapologetic rest. No productivity. No self-improvement. No "recharging so you can be more effective." Just stillness. It sounds easy. The Binding makes it feel like dying.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Platform</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Feed</div>

    <p>You build your own. Not the Feed's algorithm — <em>yours</em>. A space you control, a community you curate, a following that listens to you because of who you are, not what the algorithm decided to amplify. It feels like the old internet. It feels like connection.</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">A loyal audience that cannot be taken from you. Unlike the Feed's charisma, this influence is <em>personal</em> — these people trust you, specifically, and no algorithm can redirect their attention. You can speak uncomfortable truths and they listen. You have a platform the Feed doesn't control.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> You must protect your community. Not just care for them — <em>control access</em>. Gatekeep. Decide who's in and who's out. Moderate, curate, exclude. You cannot allow dissent within your space because dissent feels like a threat to the thing you built. You become a smaller, meaner version of the thing you escaped.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Your "alternative" community generates engagement. Drama at the margins. Hot takes about what you're doing differently. People watching your experiment to see if it fails. The Feed doesn't care that you left — your departure is content. Your community is a subculture, and subcultures are the Feed's R&D department. Every innovation you pioneer gets absorbed, repackaged, and deployed at scale. You are a free beta tester for the thing you hate.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Platform's Escape Clause: open the gates. Remove every barrier, every rule, every distinction between your community and the outside. Let anyone in, let anyone speak, let the thing you built become something you don't control. Surrender ownership of the space you made. It might survive. It might not. That's the point.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Squat</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Lease</div>

    <p>You stop paying. Not because you can't — because you <em>refuse</em>. You find a place the Lease forgot, a building off the books, a space that belongs to no one. You claim it. You make it yours — really yours, not rented, not mortgaged, not owed. For the first time, you live somewhere without a landlord.</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">True ownership. A space that is supernaturally yours — not warded by the Lease's power but by your own stubborn claim. The space sustains itself: pipes work, the roof holds, heat exists. As long as you hold it, it is inviolable. Not even the Lease can enter without your permission.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> You cannot leave. Not "cannot leave the building" — you cannot leave the <em>idea</em> of the space. You become territorial, possessive, anchored. Travel feels like dying. Distance from your space makes you physically ill. You didn't escape the Lease — you became your own landlord, and your tenant is yourself.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Your claimed space becomes a landmark — proof that property "can be had" if you just want it enough. Others try to squat. Most fail. The Lease cracks down harder everywhere else, citing your success as justification. "We have to protect against <em>this kind of thing</em>." Your freedom tightens the Lease's grip on everyone who isn't you. And you can't leave your space long enough to help them.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Squat's Escape Clause: abandon it. Walk out the door with nothing and don't look back. Let someone else have it — not someone you chose, not someone worthy, just the next person who needs a roof. Give up the only place that was ever truly yours.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Cure</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Benefit</div>

    <p>You find the answer. Not through the system — outside it. An herb, a technique, a revelation, a practice that genuinely works and doesn't require insurance, doesn't require a copay, doesn't require the Benefit's permission. You can heal without the middleman. It is real, and it is free.</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Healing that operates completely outside the Benefit's framework. No coverage required, no prior authorization, no network restrictions. Your power works on anyone, regardless of their status in the system. Pure, ungatekept medicine.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> You cannot use conventional medicine — not for yourself, not for others. Hospitals repel you. Pharmaceuticals turn to chalk in your mouth. If your alternative cure can't fix it, it doesn't get fixed. And there will be things it can't fix.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You become a symbol that "the system isn't necessary." People see your cures and abandon their coverage — coverage that, for all its cruelty, was keeping them alive. Some of them come to you. You can help some. Not all. The ones you can't help have already canceled their insurance. The Benefit uses your existence to justify its own: "See what happens when people go outside the network? They get hurt. They need us." Your liberation is the Benefit's marketing.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Cure's Escape Clause: walk into a hospital and ask for help. Submit to the system you rejected. Fill out the forms. Wait in the waiting room. Accept that some things require infrastructure, even cruel infrastructure, and that refusing the system entirely is its own kind of prison.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Autodidact</div>
    <div class="patron-title">False Exit from the Credential</div>

    <p>You teach yourself. Not through the Credential's institutions — through raw, unmediated experience. You read the forbidden books, you learn from the uncertified, you build knowledge from the ground up without anyone's permission. Your expertise is real. Your credentials are "I know what I'm talking about, and I can prove it."</p>

    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Grant</span>
      <span class="def-desc">Ungatekept knowledge. You can learn from any source without the Credential's filter. Restricted information becomes accessible. Paywalled research opens for you. The truth of things reveals itself to direct investigation, bypassing every institutional intermediary.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Binding</span>
      <span class="def-desc"><em>(revealed in play)</em> You cannot trust credentialed sources. Not "choose not to" — <em>cannot</em>. Peer-reviewed research feels like propaganda. Expert consensus triggers visceral rejection. Doctors, scientists, professors — their words curdle in your ears. You must verify everything yourself, from first principles. The Binding doesn't make you wrong. It makes you incapable of building on anyone else's work.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="def">
      <span class="def-term">The Redirect</span>
      <span class="def-desc">You become the poster child for "do your own research." Your genuine expertise — real, hard-won, accurate — gives credibility to an entire ecosystem of people who distrust institutions for much worse reasons. Conspiracy theorists, charlatans, and grifters point to you as proof that the credentialed establishment is a lie. The Credential uses you to justify its own gatekeeping: "This is why we need standards. Look at what self-taught <em>looks like</em> at scale." Your liberation discredits the very concept of accessible knowledge.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Autodidact's Escape Clause: enroll. Go back to school — not because you need to learn, but because you're willing to sit in a classroom and let someone else teach you. Accept a credential. Submit to evaluation. Let someone with a title tell you something you already know, and say "thank you." It will feel like surrender. That's the point.</div>
  </div>

  <h3>GM Guidance: The Tragedy of False Exits</h3>

  <p>The key to running False Exits is <strong>patience</strong>. The Grant should feel genuinely liberating for at least a session or two. Let the player enjoy it. Let them feel like they've beaten the system. The horror of a False Exit is not in the reveal of the Binding — it's in the slow, dawning recognition that their freedom is <em>productive</em>. That the system is <em>benefiting</em> from their rebellion. That the exit was a feature, not a bug.</p>

  <p>The Redirect should never be announced by the GM. It should emerge through play — NPCs making different choices because of the player's example, Institutions adapting, the world shifting in ways that make the character's liberation feel increasingly hollow. The player should be the one who says "wait — am I making this worse?" That's the moment. That's the horror.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Cruelest Escape Clauses</span>
    Notice that every False Exit's Escape Clause requires the character to <strong>do the thing the False Exit was designed to make unthinkable</strong>. The Lottery demands generosity. The Hustle demands rest. The Platform demands surrender of control. The system inoculates you against the cure. The way out of the false freedom is always through the one door you can no longer bring yourself to open — and it was designed that way.
  </div>


  <!-- PLAYING THE GRIND -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">At the Table</span>Running the Grind</h2>

  <h3>Session Structure</h3>

  <p>Each session of the Grind should begin with the <strong>Overhead Question</strong> and end with the <strong>Check-In</strong>. In between, the story is whatever it needs to be — but the economic pressure should be a persistent background hum, not the entire melody.</p>

  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Opening</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The GM asks each player: "How are you keeping the lights on?" This is a chance for brief roleplay, a Contract complication, or a simple "I'm covered." Don't linger unless something is collapsing.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Close</span>
    <span class="def-desc">At the end of the session, the table discusses: did anyone earn or lose a Burnout box? Did anyone experience a genuine moment of human connection that clears one? This is a group decision — the system trusts the table.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Tone Guidance</h3>

  <p>The Grind is horror, but it is <strong>ambient horror</strong> — the horror of systems, not monsters. The scariest moments should be quiet: realizing you can't quit, realizing you've changed, realizing you've started enforcing the Bindings on others without being asked to. The Institutions are not villains with plans. They are weather. You do not defeat weather. You survive it, or you find shelter, or you don't.</p>

  <p>That said, the Grind is not nihilism. The entire point of the solidarity mechanics — Burnout clearing, Collective Action — is that <strong>the system has a weakness and it is people caring about each other</strong>. Campaigns in the Grind should feel like heist movies where the thing you're stealing is your own autonomy. The wins are small and precious and real.</p>

  <h3>What Victory Looks Like</h3>

  <p>You will not destroy an Institution. That is not the scale of this story. Victory in the Grind is local: freeing a neighborhood from one predatory subsidiary, getting someone's Desperate Deal annulled, building a network of people who watch out for each other outside the contractual framework. The Institutions will still be there tomorrow. But tonight, in this apartment, with these people, you are free. That has to be enough. Sometimes it is.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">A Note on Hope</span>
    The Grind is not a lecture. It is a horror setting that uses the language of economic exploitation because that language is already horrifying. But games are played by people at a table, and people at a table deserve to have a good time. The darkness is the context. The story is about what your characters do inside it. Let them be brave. Let them be angry. Let them be kind. The system wins when people stop trying. Don't let the game do that to your players.
