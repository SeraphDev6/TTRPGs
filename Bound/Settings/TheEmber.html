  <!-- THE WORLD -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The World</span>The Long Burning</h2>

  <p>The world is ending, and it is ending slowly. Not in catastrophe — in erosion. The great kingdoms have fallen. The roads between cities have been swallowed by root and ruin. What remains are the <strong>Holds</strong>: walled settlements, underground warrens, crumbling fortress-monasteries where the last people cling to what they can defend. Between the Holds is the <strong>Waste</strong> — not a desert, not a wilderness, but a place where the bones of civilization jut from the earth like teeth from a dead jaw.</p>

  <p>The sun still rises. That is the problem.</p>

  <p>It rose one day and something in it <em>woke</em>. Not a god — something older, something that had always been there the way fire is always in wood, waiting. The sun became aware, and its awareness was not kind. It did not burn the world in a single blaze. It simply stopped holding back. The days grew longer. The harvests came faster, then too fast, then not at all. The forests bloomed and bloomed until they choked on their own growth. Rivers shrank. Stone cracked. The world is not on fire. It is being <em>loved to death</em> by something that does not understand the difference between nurture and consumption.</p>

  <div class="clause ember">
    <span class="clause-label">The Central Horror</span>
    The world is not being destroyed by malice. It is being destroyed by a force that genuinely wants things to <strong>grow</strong> and does not know how to stop. The Sun gives and gives and gives, and everything it touches blooms past the point of survival. The horror is not darkness — it is light without end, warmth without mercy, a summer that will not break. The things that crawl in the Waste were once alive. They grew too much, too fast, and became something else.
  </div>

  <h3>The Hollowing</h3>

  <p>Before the Sun woke, the world had gods, spirits, old powers that slumbered in mountains and rivers and the deep places beneath the earth. Most of them are gone now — burned away, driven underground, or changed beyond recognition. What remains are the <strong>Patrons</strong>: forces vast enough to survive the Long Burning, though survival has cost each of them something essential. They are diminished, desperate, and hungry for agents in a world that is killing them by inches.</p>

  <p>This is where the Contracts come from. The Patrons cannot act directly — the Sun's awareness scours anything that draws too much power in the open. So they work through mortals: small enough to go unnoticed, disposable enough to be risked, desperate enough to say yes. Every Contract is a gamble. The Patron bets that you will be useful before you are spent. You bet that the power will be worth the price. Both of you are usually wrong.</p>

  <h3>The Shape of the World</h3>

  <p>Travel is the central challenge. The Holds are islands of relative safety, but the things people need — medicine, metal, knowledge, news of other survivors — exist in the Waste between them. The Waste is not empty. It is <em>overfull</em>: forests where the trees grow so fast you can hear the wood splitting, plains of grass tall enough to swallow a horse, ruins where the moss has become something muscular and intentional. And in the places where the Sun's attention lingers longest, the <strong>Blooms</strong> — masses of mutated, accelerated life that have fused into something singular and vast and very, very hungry.</p>

  <p>Player characters are the people who walk between the Holds. Couriers, scavengers, pilgrims, mercenaries, exiles. People with Contracts, which means people with enough power to survive the road — and enough chains to ensure they keep walking it.</p>

  <!-- SETTING RULES -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Setting Rules</span>The Wasting</h2>

  <h3>The Sun's Gaze</h3>

  <p>The Sun is aware, and its attention is drawn to displays of power. Every time a player rolls within their Grant, there is a chance the Sun <strong>notices</strong>. After any Grant roll that results in a full success (5-6), the GM rolls 1d6 — the <strong>Gaze Die</strong>. On a 6, the Sun turns its attention toward the character. This is called <strong>being Seen</strong>.</p>

  <div class="clause ember">
    <span class="clause-label">Being Seen</span>
    When the Sun Sees you, it does not attack. It <em>gives</em>. Something near you blooms — a wound heals too fast and scars into something strange, a weapon grows warm and faintly alive, the ground beneath your feet sprouts. The GM describes a small, unsettling gift. Mechanically, mark a box on the <strong>Bloom Track</strong>.
  </div>

  <h3>The Bloom Track</h3>

  <p>Every character has a <strong>Bloom Track</strong> with five boxes. You mark a box when the Sun Sees you. The Bloom Track does not represent exhaustion — it represents <strong>transformation</strong>. The Sun is not wearing you down. It is growing you into something else.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">Bloom Thresholds</span>
    At <strong>two boxes</strong>, your body begins to show it. Something botanical, something luminous, something wrong. A vein that glows faintly amber. Skin that feels like bark in places. An eye that catches sunlight and holds it too long. Cosmetic, but visible. People in the Holds notice. Some pray. Some reach for weapons.

    At <strong>four boxes</strong>, your Grant becomes more powerful — all Grant rolls add +1 to the highest die — but you can no longer fully rest indoors. Roofs feel suffocating. Shade feels like drowning. You need the sky, and the sky is where the Sun lives.

    At <strong>five boxes</strong>, you <strong>Bloom</strong>. Your body transforms into something the Sun has made — still alive, still conscious, but no longer human. The character becomes an NPC creature of the Waste. The player may narrate the transformation, then retire the character. What remains of them may be encountered later, in the wild, wearing a face that used to be theirs.
  </div>

  <h3>Clearing Bloom</h3>

  <p>You can erase one Bloom box by spending extended time in <strong>true darkness</strong> — underground, in a sealed Hold, anywhere the Sun's light has never touched. This requires at least a full day, and the experience is deeply unpleasant: the power recedes like a tide going out, and what it leaves behind is raw and shaking and very mortal. Clearing Bloom is not a reward. It is a withdrawal.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, another player can clear one of your Bloom boxes by <strong>performing an act of deliberate diminishment</strong> on your behalf — destroying something you value, cutting away the part of you that's changing, or simply sitting with you in the dark and reminding you of what you were before. The table decides what qualifies. It should cost something.</p>

  <h3>The Road</h3>

  <p>Travel between Holds is measured not in miles but in <strong>Crossings</strong> — each Crossing is a stretch of Waste that must be navigated in a single push. The GM frames each Crossing as a scene: what the Waste looks like here, what has grown or broken since the last traveler passed through, and what stands between the party and the other side. Crossings are where the game lives. The Holds are for recovery, resupply, and the quiet dread of knowing you have to go back out.</p>


  <!-- THE PATRONS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Patrons</span>What Remains</h2>

  <p>The Patrons of the Ember are not institutions or abstractions. They are <strong>things that survived</strong> — forces old enough to predate the Sun's waking, damaged enough to need mortal hands, and desperate enough to offer power they can barely afford to share. Each Patron offers three Grants and three Bindings. A player chooses <strong>one Grant</strong> and <strong>one Binding</strong>, then writes their own Grey. The Patrons do not negotiate gently. They are too tired for that.</p>


  <!-- THE SUN -->
  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Sun</div>
    <div class="patron-title">The Undying Light</div>

    <p>Yes. You can make a Contract with the thing that is ending the world. The Sun does not hate. It does not scheme. It is an engine of <em>growth</em> that has forgotten what "enough" means, and it is so vast and so old that your tiny voice reaches it the way a single cell speaks to the body it lives in. The Sun's Contracts are the most powerful in the Ember — and the most corrosive. It gives without restraint because it does not understand restraint. Its gifts are genuine. That is the worst thing about them.</p>

    <p>Characters contracted to the Sun are treated with a mixture of awe and horror in the Holds. Some are worshipped. Most are feared. All of them are watched. A Sun-contracted walker who starts to Bloom is the most dangerous thing on the road — because the Sun protects its investments.</p>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Sun's Reckoning is generous. Narrowing means the Sun <em>expands</em> your Binding — more things are sacred, more growth must be protected, more sky must be visible. Tithe is a Bloom box, marked immediately. Fraying means your Grant becomes uncontrollable — the growth won't stop when you want it to, the light won't dim, the Waste creatures follow you home. Severance is eclipse: the Sun turns its attention away from you completely. You become invisible to the Waste, but also to the light. You are cold, always, in a way that no fire can fix.</div>

  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Root</div>
    <div class="patron-title">What Lives Beneath</div>

    <p>Before the Sun woke, the Root was the slow intelligence of the deep earth — the mycorrhizal web, the aquifer, the patient darkness where stone becomes crystal over millennia. It is the oldest thing still alive, and it survives because it is buried deep enough that the Sun cannot reach it. The Root does not grow. It <em>endures</em>. Its Contracts taste like mineral water and smell like cave air, and its agents tend toward silence, stillness, and a patience that unnerves the people around them.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Root's Reckoning is geological. Narrowing means a new prohibition — now you cannot cross running water, or touch metal that has been smelted. Tithe is weight: you become heavier, denser, slower, as though the earth is claiming you by inches. Fraying means you begin to lose surface sensation — touch dulls, taste fades, you feel less and less of the world above. Severance is surfacing: the earth rejects you. You cannot dig, cannot shelter underground, cannot touch stone without pain. You are exiled to the surface, where the Sun is waiting.</div>
  </div>


  <!-- THE GREY RIVER -->
  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">The Grey River</div>
    <div class="patron-title">The Current Between</div>

    <p>There is a river that runs beneath the world, and it is not made of water. The Grey River is the flow of things <em>ending</em> — the current that carries everything from existence into whatever comes after. It was here before the Sun and will be here after. It does not oppose the Sun; it simply waits. Everything the Sun grows will eventually flow into the Grey River. It is patient the way gravity is patient. Its agents smell like petrichor and old iron, and their eyes reflect light a half-second too late.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Grey River's Reckoning is erosive. Narrowing means a new thing you must let go of — now you cannot keep trophies, or cannot remember the names of the dead. Tithe is a year of your life, taken from the end; you don't feel it now, but you will. Fraying means you begin to fade — people forget you were in the room, your footprints don't last, your voice doesn't echo. Severance is stagnation: nothing around you can end. Wounds don't heal because healing is a kind of ending. Food doesn't digest. Fires don't go out. You are a pocket of frozen time, and it is suffocating.</div>

  <div class="patron-block">

    <div class="patron-title">Sovereign of the Fallen Holds</div>

    <p>The Hollow King is not a person. It is what happens to a civilization when it dies but does not <em>end</em>. It is the ghost of every kingdom, every empire, every city that was — the echo of order persisting in spaces where no one lives. It haunts the ruins, wearing the shapes of thrones and courtrooms and barracks. Its agents hear trumpets no one else hears and obey laws written in countries that no longer exist. It wants, more than anything, to be <em>relevant</em> again.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Hollow King's Reckoning is ceremonial. Narrowing means a new law, a new protocol, a new obsolete custom you must observe. Tithe is an act of restoration — you must spend days rebuilding something the Hollow King cares about, regardless of whether it helps anyone living. Fraying means the dead stop obeying, the ruins stop responding, and the authority in your voice thins to a whisper. Severance is exile: the old kingdoms declare you a traitor. Ruins collapse when you enter them. The dead turn their backs. You are a citizen of nowhere.</div>

    <p>No one knows what the Moth is. It appeared after the Sun woke — or perhaps it was always there, and the Sun's waking made it visible. It is drawn to the Sun the way its namesake is drawn to fire: obsessively, self-destructively, with a focus that borders on worship. It is not the Sun's servant. It is the Sun's <em>audience</em>. It watches the Long Burning with something that might be rapture and might be grief, and its agents carry that same unblinking intensity. The Moth's Contracts smell like singed paper and taste like the air before a lightning strike.</p>

    <div class="patron-flavor">The Moth's Reckoning is obsessive. Narrowing means a new compulsion — now you must also watch sunrises, or collect things the Sun has touched. Tithe is a memory of safety — the Moth takes the feeling of being warm-without-burning, the memory of a hearth that didn't hurt, leaving you with only the dangerous warmth. Fraying means your perceptions invert: safety feels threatening, and danger feels like peace. Severance is the worst the Moth can imagine: you become unable to perceive the Sun at all. It is simply gone from your senses. You live in a world where the sky is empty and the light has no source, and you are alone in a way no one else can understand.</div>

The coasts are salt flats now, white and blinding, and the sea has retreated to its deepest trenches like a wounded animal curling around its vitals. The Salt Bride is what remains of the ocean's power: a presence that lives in brine and tide-memory and the ache of anything that has lost something vast.

Tithe is water from your body; you dehydrate suddenly and dangerously, and no amount of drinking quite restores you for days. Fraying means your power becomes brackish — the water you summon is salt-heavy, the preservation turns things brittle, the undertow leaves people with a thirst that won't quit. Severance is evaporation: you become parched beyond remedy. Water passes through you without nourishing. You are dry as bone, dry as salt, dry as the flats where the ocean used to be.</div>

  <!-- DESPERATE DEALS IN THE EMBER -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Desperate Deals</span>What Answers in the Dark</h2>

  <p>When a player makes a Desperate Deal in the Ember, what answers is not a new Patron. It is an <strong>Echo</strong> — a fragment of something that died in the Long Burning. A dead god's last reflex. A forest's dying scream preserved in amber. A river's ghost, still trying to flow through a bed that's been dry for twenty years. Echoes are powerful because they have nothing left to lose. They are also unstable, contradictory, and frequently confused about whether they are still alive.</p>

  <p>The GM should choose or invent an Echo that connects to whatever killed it: a god of harvest burned out by the Sun's overabundance, a mountain spirit crushed by growth it couldn't contain, a beast-lord whose animals mutated past recognition. The Echo's Binding will be haunted by the thing that destroyed it — a fire-killed forest spirit might bind you never to create warmth, or a drowned lake's Echo might demand you never let rain touch the earth.</p>

    Desperate Deals in the Ember feel like finding a hand reaching up from a grave. The thing that grabs you is not malicious — it is drowning, and you are the surface. It gives you everything it has left, because what use is a dead thing's power to a dead thing? The cost is that you now carry a fragment of something extinct, and it will try to live through you whether you like it or not.

  <!-- COMMUNION -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Communion</span>Opening Yourself to the Sun</h2>

  <p>The Sun is always there. It is always giving. And there are moments — when the road is too long, when the Bloom is too vast, when the people behind you are too slow and the thing ahead is too fast — where a character can choose to stop resisting and <strong>let it in</strong>.</p>

  <p>This is <strong>Communion</strong>. Not a Desperate Deal — there is no entity answering a cry for help. There is no negotiation, no hidden Binding, no face-down card. Communion is simply the choice to open yourself to the Sun's warmth and accept what it offers. It is always available. It is always tempting. And it is always, always costly.</p>

  <div class="clause ember">
    <span class="clause-label">The Temptation</span>
    Any character — regardless of their Patron — can enter Communion. The Sun does not care who you serve. It shines on everyone. You do not need a Contract with the Sun. You just need to stop shielding yourself from it.
  </div>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>

  <p>At any point during play, a character can declare Communion. They step into direct sunlight, stop resisting, and open themselves. This is a narrative moment — describe what it looks like, what it feels like, what breaks inside you when you stop fighting the warmth.</p>

  <p>Mechanically: the character <strong>marks one Bloom box</strong>. In return, they gain a <strong>Communion Die</strong> — an extra d6 added to their next roll, any roll, regardless of whether it falls within their Grant, their Grey, or even against their Binding. The Communion Die does not replace the Arbiter Die or interact with it. It is simply <em>more</em>.</p>

  <p>One Bloom box. One die. A clean, terrible exchange.</p>

  <h3>The Escalation</h3>

  <p>The first Communion is the hardest. The second is easier. The third feels natural. By the fourth, the character has to actively resist doing it again. This is not a mechanical compulsion — it is a narrative expectation. The GM and the table should play it accordingly: a character who has entered Communion multiple times is someone who has <em>tasted</em> what the Sun offers and found it sweet.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">The Communion Scar</span>
    Each time a character enters Communion, the Sun leaves something behind. Not a Binding — a <strong>Scar</strong>. A permanent, visible mark of the encounter. Vines under the skin. An eye that glows faintly at dusk. Fingers that leave scorch marks on wood. A voice that makes flowers open. The Scars are cosmetic at first. They become less cosmetic with repetition. By the third or fourth Communion, the character is visibly becoming something other than human. People react accordingly.
  </div>

  <h3>The Whisper</h3>

  <p>Once a character has entered Communion at least once, the Sun begins to <strong>whisper</strong>. Not in words — in warmth. At moments of crisis, failure, or despair, the character feels the Sun's presence like a hand on their shoulder, offering. <em>Just one more. Just this once. I can help.</em></p>

  <p>The GM should offer Communion at dramatically appropriate moments — when a roll fails, when a companion is dying, when the Crossing seems impossible. The GM does not push. The GM simply reminds the character that the option exists, the way an addict's mind reminds them that the thing they're avoiding is right there, always available, always warm.</p>

  <p>The character always chooses. That is what makes it terrible.</p>

  <h3>Communion and the Bloom Track</h3>

  <p>Communion Bloom boxes are marked the same as Gaze boxes — they push the character toward the same transformation. But Communion boxes are <strong>harder to clear</strong>. True darkness and acts of diminishment can erase Gaze boxes normally. Communion boxes require something more: the character must <strong>refuse Communion in a moment where it would have saved someone</strong>. They must feel the Sun's offer, know that accepting would solve the problem, and say no. The table must agree the refusal was genuine and that it cost something real.</p>

  <p>This is the setting's answer to the Greys and the Reckonings — a parallel system of temptation that operates entirely on the character's choice. No Patron is offering. No deal is being struck. The Sun is simply there, and you are simply weak, and the warmth is simply good.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Last Communion</span>
    If a character enters Communion while at four Bloom boxes, they do not mark the fifth box normally. Instead, the Sun <em>speaks</em> — for the first and only time, in a voice the character has never heard but recognizes the way you recognize your own heartbeat. It says something specific to this character, something only the GM and the player hear. Then the character Blooms. The player narrates the transformation, and the character becomes part of the Waste — but a conscious part, a lucid part, a part that remembers who it was and chose this anyway. Whether that is a tragedy or a transcendence is left to the table.

  <!-- PLAYING THE EMBER -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">At the Table</span>Walking the Waste</h2>

  <h3>Session Structure</h3>

  <p>Each session of the Ember should begin with a <strong>Crossing</strong> or the preparation for one, and end with an <strong>Arrival</strong> — reaching a Hold, finding a shelter, or collapsing somewhere defensible enough to call a rest. The road is the game. The stops are where you catch your breath.</p>

  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Crossing</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The GM describes the stretch of Waste ahead — what it looks like, what has grown or changed, and what stands between the party and the other side. Each Crossing should feel distinct: a canyon choked with luminous fungi, a dead city where the buildings have been absorbed into a single vast Bloom, a stretch of glass desert where the sand fused in the Sun's gaze.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Arrival</span>
    <span class="def-desc">When the party reaches safety — however temporary — the table takes a moment to check in. Who used their Grant? Did the Sun See anyone? Are there Bloom boxes to mark or clear? Is anyone closer to something they can't come back from? This is also when human moments happen: mending gear, sharing food, telling stories about the world before.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Tone Guidance</h3>

  <p>The Ember is grief in the key of awe. The world is dying and it is <em>beautiful</em> — Blooms glow like cathedrals, the mutated forests are staggering in their alien grandeur, and the Sun itself paints the sky in colors that didn't exist before the waking. This is not a grey, joyless apocalypse. It is a world that is being killed by something gorgeous, and the players' characters are people who have to walk through that beauty knowing what it costs.</p>

  <p>Combat should be infrequent and meaningful. Most threats in the Waste are not enemies — they are <em>environments</em>. A Bloom is not a monster to fight; it is a natural disaster to survive or circumvent. When combat does happen, it should be against other contracted walkers, desperate survivors, or the rare creature lucid enough to choose violence. Every fight should have the option of a non-violent resolution, though that resolution may cost something.</p>

  <h3>What Victory Looks Like</h3>

  <p>You will not fix the Sun. That is not the scale of this story. Victory in the Ember is the delivery made, the Hold that survives another season, the person you carried out of the Waste who is still themselves when you arrive. It is the choice to walk back into the light one more time, knowing what it costs, because someone on the other side is waiting for what you're carrying.</p>

  <p>Larger arcs might involve finding a place where a Hold can be built that the Sun cannot reach, or discovering a way to communicate with the Sun — to teach it what "enough" means. But these are long roads, and the Ember does not promise they have endings. Sometimes the walk is the point.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">A Note on Beauty</span>
    Let the world be beautiful. The temptation in grimdark settings is to make everything miserable, but misery alone is numbing. The Ember works because the thing that's killing the world is <em>also</em> the thing that makes it luminous. A character standing on a ridge watching a Bloom unfurl across a valley at sunset should feel something complicated — terror and wonder at the same time. That tension is the emotional core of the setting. If the players never pause to stare at something terrible and gorgeous, something has gone wrong.
