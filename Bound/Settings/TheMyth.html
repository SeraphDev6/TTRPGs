  <!-- THE WORLD -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The World</span>The Land That Was Not Made for You</h2>

  <p>The world is young, and it belongs to other things. Gods live on the mountaintops — not metaphorically, not in temples, but <em>on</em> them: their voices in the thunder, their moods in the weather, their arguments in the earthquake. They dwell beneath seas that remember every drowned name, in groves where light bends wrong and time runs thick as honey. The world was made for them, or they were made for it, and the distinction does not matter. What matters is that you were not.</p>

  <p>Between the divine domains lie the mortal lands: coastal villages where fishermen tie prayers into their nets, cities built in the shadow of temples that predate the cities by millennia, roads that end where the wild begins. These are the <strong>Holds</strong> — not fortresses, but places where mortals have carved enough space to live without asking permission from something vast. Beyond the walls, the world is unmapped forest, mountains that shift when unobserved, seas that remember your name if you say it too close to the water.</p>

  <p>And there are monsters. Not evil — not most of them. Monsters are divine mistakes, sacred guardians, punishments given flesh and set loose with instructions long forgotten. They are the landscape's teeth. The world beyond the Holds is not hostile. It is simply <em>not yours</em>, and it does not care whether you survive the trespass.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Central Horror</span>
    The gods are real. They gave you power because it amused them, or because they needed a hand that could bleed. You are mortal carrying divine fire that was not made for mortal hands. Every use makes you less mortal — not stronger, not better, just <em>less</em>. The space between mortal and divine is not a spectrum. It is a cliff. Heroes do not retire. They become constellations, cautionary tales, names that mothers use to frighten children into obedience. The horror is not that the gods will destroy you. The horror is that you will <strong>become something that is no longer you</strong>, and the gods will call it a promotion.
  </div>

  <h3>Who You Are</h3>

  <p>Player characters are heroes in the oldest sense — mortals who bargained with gods and walk the line between glory and annihilation. People see it in their eyes: something too bright, too certain, too <em>much</em>. Monsters smell it on their skin. Other mortals step aside on the road, not out of respect but out of the same instinct that moves you away from a lightning-struck tree.</p>

  <p>Heroes wander. They move between Holds — cities, villages, sacred sites — taking work, answering prayers, settling debts that were old before they were born. Between Holds, the Wilds wait: places where the divine bleeds through and the rules of mortal life fray at the edges. This is where the game lives. The Holds are for rest and the slow, precious work of being human. The Wilds are where you discover what you're becoming.</p>


  <!-- THEMES -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Themes</span>What This Setting Is About</h2>

  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">Hubris</span>
    <span class="def-desc">Not pride — the slow erosion of the boundary between servant and served. Every feat that defies mortality pushes you closer to divinity, and divinity is a country where mortals cannot breathe. The gods do not punish ambition. They punish <em>forgetting what you are</em>.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Sacred</span>
    <span class="def-desc">Invisible boundaries layered throughout the world. Some places, creatures, and acts belong to the gods alone. Crossing those boundaries has consequences that do not care what you intended. The sacred is not a moral judgment. It is a property of the landscape, like gravity.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">Glory</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The currency heroes chase — deeds worthy of song, acts that draw the gaze of gods. But divine attention is never comfortable. To be glorious is to be <em>seen</em>, and the things that see you have agendas older than your bloodline. Glory is the light that casts the sharpest shadow.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">Mortality</span>
    <span class="def-desc">You will die. Specifically, personally, and probably in a way that people will talk about. The question is not how to escape death but what to do with the time you have — and whether the things you do with that time are worth the cost of doing them.</span>
  </div>


  <!-- SETTING RULES -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Setting Rules</span>The Weight of Heaven</h2>

  <h3>The Hubris Track</h3>

  <p>Every character has a <strong>Hubris Track</strong> with five boxes. You mark a box when:</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Hubris Triggers</span>
    <ol>
      <li>You use your Grant to accomplish something no mortal could — not difficult, but <em>impossible</em> without divine power.</li>
      <li>You defy a god directly: refuse a command, break a sacred law, challenge divine authority.</li>
      <li>You enter sacred ground uninvited (see <strong>Trespass</strong>).</li>
      <li>You kill a divine creature — a monster born from the gods, a sacred beast, anything that carries heaven's mark.</li>
      <li>You accept worship, or allow yourself to be treated as divine.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">Hubris Thresholds</span>
    At <strong>three boxes — The Gaze</strong>: a god notices you. The GM names which god and what drew their attention. From this moment, divine interference enters the story — not as punishment, not yet, but as <em>interest</em>. The god watches. It sends signs. It tests. Other heroes and priests can see the mark of divine attention on you. Some kneel. Some run.

    <br><br>At <strong>five boxes — The Apotheosis</strong>: the mortal shell cannot hold what you are becoming. The character's final scene: choose to <strong>ascend</strong> (become divine, lose yourself utterly — your name joins the pantheon but <em>you</em> are gone) or <strong>cling to mortality</strong> (the divine fire tears itself free, leaving you broken, powerless, and profoundly human). Either way, the hero's story ends. What remains is a legend or a ruin.
  </div>

  <h3>Clearing Hubris</h3>

  <p>You can erase one Hubris box through <strong>Acts of Humility</strong> — deliberate, genuine acknowledgments of your mortality. Bowing at an altar with real reverence, not performance. Accepting failure without reaching for your Grant. Eating a meal you cooked badly and not complaining. Admitting you are afraid.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, another hero can clear one of your Hubris boxes by <strong>Witnessing your mortality</strong> — being present with you in a moment of genuine human weakness and choosing to stay. Not helping, not fixing, not offering divine solutions. Just <em>being there</em> while you are small and scared and mortal. The Witnessing must cost the other hero something: time, safety, tactical advantage, or pride. It cannot be free.</p>

  <p>This is the setting's thesis given teeth: <em>other mortals who remind you what you are save heroes from becoming myths.</em></p>

  <h3>The Hearthfire</h3>

  <p>At the start of each session, the GM asks the table: <strong>"Where do you rest, and what keeps you human?"</strong></p>

  <p>Each player names one mortal thing. A meal cooked over a real fire. A letter written to someone who may never read it. A wound tended without divine aid, slowly and painfully. A song sung badly. A game of dice played for worthless stakes. These things do not grant mechanical benefit. They are the reason the mechanics matter.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">The Hearthfire</span>
    The Hearthfire is not a resource or a mechanic. It is a ritual. It exists to remind the table — before the monsters and the gods and the terrible choices — that these are people. People who eat and sleep and do small, pointless, beautiful things. The Hubris Track measures how far a character has drifted from this. The Hearthfire is the anchor they drift from.
  </div>


  <!-- TRESPASS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Trespass</span>Walking on Holy Ground</h2>

  <p>The world is layered with sacred ground — places that belong to the gods. Groves where no mortal has walked and lived. Mountain passes where the wind speaks in a dead language. River crossings where the water demands a name before it lets you pass. These places are powerful, dangerous, and frequently between you and where you need to go.</p>

  <p>When the party enters sacred ground, the GM declares it. The air changes. The light bends. Something old becomes aware of your presence. Characters who continue forward are <strong>Trespassing</strong>.</p>

  <div class="clause blood">
    <span class="clause-label">Trespass</span>
    While Trespassing: all Grant rolls gain <strong>+1d6</strong>. The divine bleeds through here, and power comes easier — too easy. On entry, each character marks <strong>1 Hubris box</strong>. The GM gains one <strong>Portent</strong> — a narrative complication that will manifest before the party leaves the sacred ground.
  </div>

  <h3>Portents</h3>

  <p>When the GM spends a Portent, they choose or roll from the following:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>d6</th><th>Portent</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>1</td><td><strong>The Guardian Wakes</strong> — something that protects this place stirs. It may be a creature, a spirit, or the ground itself.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td><strong>The Landscape Shifts</strong> — the sacred ground rearranges. Paths close. New ones open. The way back is not the way you came.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td><strong>The God Speaks</strong> — a divine voice addresses the party directly. It may command, question, or simply observe. It expects an answer.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Time Distorts</strong> — hours pass in moments, or moments stretch into hours. When the party emerges, the world has moved without them.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td><strong>The Grant Awakens</strong> — a character's Grant activates involuntarily, doing what the character wants most — or what the god wants most. The character does not choose.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Something Follows</strong> — when the party leaves, something leaves with them. It may be a creature, a curse, a fragment of divine attention, or a gift they did not ask for.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Leaving Sacred Ground</h3>

  <p>When the party exits the sacred ground, each hero answers one question: <strong>"What did you take, and what did you leave behind?"</strong> The answer is true — narratively, literally true. If you say you left your fear behind, you did. If you say you took a handful of divine earth, it's in your pack. The sacred does not distinguish between metaphor and reality. Neither should the table.</p>

  <div class="clause">
    <span class="clause-label">Deeper Trespass</span>
    Some places are more sacred than others. The heart of a god's domain, the site of a divine birth or death, the place where the world's bones are visible. In these places, Trespass costs <strong>2 Hubris boxes</strong> on entry, Grant rolls gain <strong>+2d6</strong>, and the GM gains <strong>two Portents</strong>. These places are rare, terrible, and wondrous. Characters who enter them come out changed — if they come out at all.
  </div>


  <!-- THE GODS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">The Gods</span>Patrons of the Myth</h2>

  <p>The gods are real, distant, and hungry. Not for worship — for <em>use</em>. They have domains to maintain, rivals to outmaneuver, and a world to shape according to designs so vast that mortal minds cannot hold them. They value you the way a craftsman values a favorite tool: with genuine affection, and absolutely no hesitation about wearing you down to the handle.</p>

  <p>Each god offers three Grants and three Bindings. A player chooses <strong>one Grant</strong> and <strong>one Binding</strong>, then writes their own Grey. Two characters contracted to the same god may carry very different powers and very different chains. The examples below are not exhaustive; players and GMs are encouraged to invent new options that fit the god's domain.</p>


  <!-- PATRON 1 -->
  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">Athyra</div>
    <div class="patron-title">The Storm That Judges</div>

    <p><em>Athyra is the sky's anger given purpose. She is thunder that arrives before lightning, the cold wind that precedes the verdict, the silence in a courtroom before the sentence falls. Her domain is storm, law, and the terrible clarity that comes when all pretense is stripped away. She smells like ozone and wet stone. Her sacred places are mountaintops above the cloud line, open courtyards where rain collects in the cracks between paving stones, and crossroads where travelers must choose. Her sigil is a single bolt of lightning striking an open palm.</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">Athyra's Reckoning is judicial. Narrowing means a new law you must uphold — one you did not agree to and may not believe in. Tithe is a truth, dragged from you unwillingly; Athyra takes a secret and makes it public in the worst possible moment. Fraying means your storms grow wild — the weather answers your emotions, not your commands, and your anger brings lightning to places that cannot survive it. Severance is exile from the sky: clouds part above you, rain bends around you, and the wind will not carry your voice. You stand in perpetual, merciless clarity, and no storm will ever answer you again.</div>

  <!-- PATRON 2 -->
  <div class="patron-block">
    <div class="patron-name">Thalassor</div>
    <div class="patron-title">The Tide That Remembers</div>

    <p><em>Thalassor is the sea's patience. He is the current that carries the drowned to shore years after the shipwreck, the salt that preserves what should have rotted, the deep pressure that turns bone to stone. His domain is ocean, memory, and the things that surface when you stop looking for them. He smells like brine and old wood. His sacred places are tidal caves where the water breathes, harbors where ghost ships dock at moonrise, and shorelines where the sand is made of ground-down temples.

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">Thalassor's Reckoning is erosive. Narrowing means a new memory you must carry — someone else's grief, a drowned sailor's last thought, a recollection that is not yours and will not leave. Tithe is a memory of your own, pulled from you like a tooth; you know something is missing but cannot name it. Fraying means the sea follows you inland — puddles form in your footsteps, your skin tastes of salt, and the people closest to you begin dreaming of drowning. Severance is beaching: the ocean recoils from you. Water will not carry you. Rain avoids your skin. You are dry in the deepest sense — cut off from the thing that connects all shores, alone on land that suddenly feels like an island.</div>

    <p><em>Kythera is the wild's hunger. She is the rustle in the undergrowth that stops when you listen, the silence between the owl's call and the mouse's scream, the moment a predator's eyes find you through the leaves and you know — without knowing how — that the forest has decided you are prey. Her domain is wilderness, beast, growth, and the clean savagery that existed before mortals invented the word "cruelty." She smells like loam after rain and blood on bark. Her sacred places are old-growth groves where the canopy blocks the sky, dens where apex predators raise their young, and clearings where nothing grows because something beneath the soil is still feeding. Her sigil is an antler threaded with vines.</em></p>

    </div>

    <div class="patron-flavor">Kythera's Reckoning is feral. Narrowing means a new instinct you cannot ignore — now you bare your teeth when threatened, or you cannot cross running water without drinking. Tithe is a piece of your civilized self; you lose the taste for cooked food, the comfort of soft beds, the ability to make small talk. Fraying means the beast bleeds through — your eyes yellow, your nails thicken, your scent changes, and domesticated animals panic at your approach. Severance is exile from the wild: the forest goes silent when you enter, animals flee, the undergrowth parts not in welcome but in revulsion. You are cast out from the living world, a thing the wilderness has decided to forget.</div>

Narrowing means a new compulsion to create — now you must also forge, mend, or improve everything you touch, even things that were fine as they were. Tithe is something you made; Pyraxis takes your finest work, reduces it to raw material, and returns it to you unmade. Fraying means your fire loses precision — the flame that once obeyed your will begins to hunger, to spread, to take more than you intended. Severance is the cold forge: your hands lose their cunning, fire recoils from your touch, and every material you work crumbles to ash. You can see what things should become, but you can no longer make them. Vision without craft. The maker's hell.</div>

You are dying, slowly, from the inside out. Moros does not take your power. He simply stops holding the door closed.</div>

  <!-- DESPERATE DEALS -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">Desperate Deals</span>What Answers When You Scream</h2>

  <p>When a hero makes a Desperate Deal in the Myth, what answers is not a god. The gods do not come when called — they summon, they do not answer. What answers is something older. Something that existed before the gods carved the world into domains and declared it theirs.</p>

  <p>They are called the <strong>Old Things</strong>. The serpent that coils beneath the world's foundation. The void that existed before light was born. The mother of monsters, who wove the first beasts from her own sinew before the gods stole the pattern. The dark water that predates the sea. They do not have temples. They do not have sigils. They were here first, and the gods built the world <em>on top of them</em>.</p>

  <p>A hero's desperation is a crack in the world, and old things seep through cracks.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">The Vertigo</span>
    Desperate Deals in the Myth feel like vertigo — standing at the edge of something so vast that your body forgets which direction is down. The Old Things do not speak. They <em>are</em>, and their presence is an answer. They do not want worship. They do not want service. They want <strong>passage</strong> — a mortal vessel through which they can touch a world that has been built over them like a city over catacombs. Their Bindings are not restrictions. They are <em>instincts</em>, old and alien and deeply, deeply wrong.

  <!-- AT THE TABLE -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">At the Table</span>Running the Myth</h2>

  <h3>Session Structure</h3>

  <p>Each session of the Myth should begin with the <strong>Hearthfire</strong> and end with the <strong>Telling</strong>. Between them, the story is what it needs to be — monsters and gods and choices that leave scars. But the fire and the story are the frame, and the frame is what makes the painting bearable.</p>

  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Hearthfire</span>
    <span class="def-desc">The GM asks each player: "Where do you rest, and what keeps you human?" Each player names one mortal thing — small, specific, unrelated to their Grant or their glory. This is a brief ritual, not an extended scene. It exists to establish the human baseline before the mythic scale begins.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="def">
    <span class="def-term">The Telling</span>
    <span class="def-desc">At the end of the session, one player — rotating each session — tells the story of what just happened as it will be <em>remembered</em>. What was exaggerated. What was left out. What was added. The gap between truth and legend is the thesis of the Myth. The other players and the GM listen. They do not correct. The story is the story now.</span>
  </div>

  <h3>Tone Guidance</h3>

  <p>The Myth is the horror of becoming. Not body horror, not cosmic indifference — the specific, intimate terror of using power until you are no longer the person who first reached for it. The scariest moments in the Myth are not the monster attacks or the divine pronouncements. They are the quiet moments when a character uses their Grant casually, without thinking, and the table realizes they have stopped seeing it as borrowed fire. They think it's <em>theirs</em>.</p>

  <p>The Myth is <strong>not tragedy</strong>. Tragedy means the ending is predetermined — the flaw leads inevitably to the fall. The Myth is not inevitable. Characters can choose humility. They can choose the Hearthfire over the mountain. They can choose mortality. That choice has to be real, or the Hubris Track is just a countdown. The horror is that ascending feels <em>better</em> than staying human, and the choice to remain mortal requires giving up something that tastes like godhood.</p>

  <h3>What Victory Looks Like</h3>

  <p>You will not kill the gods. You will not tame the Wilds. You will not rid the world of monsters. Victory in the Myth is a village saved from the thing in the river. A monster turned aside without slaughter. A companion pulled back from the edge of Apotheosis and reminded of who they were before the fire. A child who sees a hero and is inspired rather than terrified.</p>

  <p>Victory is the story told at the Hearthfire with all heroes alive to hear it. Not all sessions will end that way. But the ones that do are worth every scar.</p>

  <div class="clause dark">
    <span class="clause-label">A Note on Divinity</span>
    The Hubris Track is not a punishment meter. It is a mirror, showing how far a character has drifted from the mortal life that makes them worth caring about. The gods are weather. The monsters are landscape. The only enemy is forgetting. When a hero returns from sacred ground with a new Hubris box and wild light in their eyes, give them a moment at the fire. Let someone hand them a bowl of bad soup. Let a child ask them a stupid question. Let them fumble with their bedroll. That moment — the small, clumsy, mortal moment after the divine one — is the whole game. Without it, you are running a power fantasy. With it, you are running a story about what power costs and what it cannot buy.
